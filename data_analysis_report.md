### Status of Open Science in Kenya: Data Analysis Report

So we managed to download about 25,000 paper abstracts with meta-data from Kenyan Authors. Now we need to makse sense of these data and identify trends. We are asking questions like:

1. Changes in the number of papers published over time (Yearly)
2. Changes in the number of open acces papers over the years (Keep in mind that access of the lack thereof maybe linked to embargo periods)
3. Colaboration trends (How can we get this information?
4. What else can we find out?

So far, this is what we have obersved. 


#### Popular Journals for Kenyan Authors
![Image](plots/papers_per_jornal.png)

From the figure above, we can observe that the East Africa Medical Journal is by far the most popular follwed by Plos One Journal for Kenyan Authors. This is followed in a distant second by Malaria Journal. Most of these are journals specific to the diseases affecting Africa: Malaria and Negelected Tropical dieseases. 


### Number of Journals per Year

Now we need to check if the number of Journals Published By Kenyans over the years. 

![peryear](plots/papers_per_year.png)

From the above figure, either we are missing some data from before 2007, of there was a sharp increase in publications starting 2008. Eitherway, we need to figure out why. 

**NB:** After double checking the data, we observe that the plot now makes sense.
