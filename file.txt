The global commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 places HIV prevention
at the centre of the response. With the disease continuing to disproportionately 
affect young populations in the Eastern and Southern African Region (ESAR),
particularly adolescent girls and young women, reducing HIV infections in this
group is integral to achieving this ambitious target. This paper examines
epidemiological patterns of the HIV epidemic among adolescents and young people, 
indicating where HIV prevention efforts need to be focused (i.e., adolescent
girls and young women, adolescent boys and young men and young key populations). 
Key innovations in the science of HIV prevention and strategies for dealing with 
programme implementation are reviewed. The paper also discusses the value of
processes to mitigate HIV vulnerability and recommends actions needed to sustain 
the HIV prevention response. Stemming the tide of new HIV infections among young 
people in the ESAR requires an amplification of efforts across all sectors, which
will safeguard past achievements and advance actions towards eliminating AIDS as 
a public health threat.
