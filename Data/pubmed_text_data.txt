Background: In high-income countries, inflammation has been associated with
increased morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals despite treatment
with antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, these findings may not be
generalizable to low-income settings.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, multivariable linear regression was used 
to compare 28 inflammatory biomarker levels in HIV-infected and uninfected
participants. Correlations between biomarkers and VACS index, FIB-4 score, and
Framingham risk score were assessed.
Results: Plasma samples from 304 Kenyans were analyzed. Compared to HIV
uninfected controls, virologically-suppressed HIV-infected participants had
higher levels of CCL5, CXCL10, FABP2, FASLG, MMP1, MMP7, sCD14, and sCD163 and
lower MMP9 (P < 0.01). CD4+/HLA-DR+CD38+ (rho 0.32, P < 0.001), sCD14 (rho 0.25, 
P = 0.004), and sCD163 (rho 0.24, P = 0.006) were correlated with the VACS index.
FABP2 was positively correlated (rho 0.28, P = 0.002), while MMP1 (rho -0.32, P <
0.001) and MMP2 (rho -0.28, P = 0.002) were inversely correlated with the FIB-4
score.
Conclusions: Differences in biomarker levels exist between well-controlled
HIV-infected participants on ART and uninfected controls. Some biomarkers are
correlated to scoring indices predictive of morbidity and mortality. These
biomarkers could serve as prognostic indicators and inform therapeutic
development.

The use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays for pathogen detection in
travelers' diarrhea (TD) field studies is limited by the on-site processing and
storage requirements for fecal specimens. The objectives of this investigation
were to i) characterize the pathogen distribution in deployed military personnel 
with TD using the TaqMan® Array Card PCR (TAC) on frozen stool and diarrheal
smears on Whatman FTA Elute cards (FTA cards), and to ii) compare TAC detection
of enteropathogen targets using smeared FTA cards and frozen stool, using TAC on 
frozen stool as the 'reference standard'. Stool samples, obtained from active
duty personnel with acute TD enrolled in a field trial, were smeared onto FTA
cards and stored at room temperature. A corresponding aliquot of stool was frozen
in a cryovial. FTA cards and frozen stool samples were tested at a central lab,
using a customized TAC for detection of TD pathogens. 187 paired frozen stool
samples and smeared FTA cards were stored for a median of 712 days (IQR 396-750) 
before testing. Overall detection rates were 78.6% for frozen stool and 73.2% for
FTA cards. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were the most common bacteria
identified. Using the TAC results on frozen stool as the reference, the overall
sensitivity and specificity of TAC on FTA cards was 72.9% and 98.0% respectively.
TAC on FTA cards demonstrated a decrease in sensitivity with increasing frozen
stool quantification cycle (Cq) (90.0% in FTA cards with a corresponding frozen
stool Cq < 30, and 72.9% in samples with a corresponding frozen stool Cq < 35).
Our findings support the use and further development of FTA cards in combination 
with a quantitative PCR assay for enteropathogen detection in TD field studies.

BACKGROUND: Despite substantial progress, gaps in the HIV care cascade remain
large: globally, while about 36.7 million people were living with HIV in 2015,
11.9 million of these individuals did not know their HIV status, 12.7 million
were in need of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 13.0 million were not virally
suppressed. We sought to deepen understanding of the barriers to care engagement 
at three critical steps of the care cascade proposed to make greatest impact for 
attaining the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets aimed at shutting down the HIV epidemic.
METHODS: Analyses were conducted among HIV-infected adults in rural East Africa. 
Qualitative data were collected using in-depth interviews among 63 individuals
participating in an ongoing test-and treat trial (NCT01864683) in its baseline
year (July 2013-June 2014). Audio recordings were transcribed, translated into
English, and coded using Atlas.ti software. Data were analyzed using a thematic
framework for explaining barriers to care engagement that drew upon both theory
and prior empirical research in similar settings.
RESULTS: Multiple barriers to engagement in care were observed. HIV-related
stigma across dimensions of anticipated, internalized and enacted stigma
manifested in denial and fears of disclosure, and influenced lapses in care
engagement across multiple steps in the cascade. Poverty (lack of food and
transport), lack of social support, work interference, prior negative experiences
with health services, drug side effects, and treatment fatigue also negatively
affected ART adherence and viral suppression. Gender differences were observed,
with work interference and denial disproportionately affecting men compared to
women.
CONCLUSION: Multiple barriers to HIV care engagement still pervade rural
sub-Saharan settings threatening the realization of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. 
To control the epidemic, efforts need to be accelerated to combat stigma. Patient
economic empowerment, innovative drug formulations, as well as more
patient-responsive health systems, may help overcome barriers to engagement in
care.

Dadaab Refugee camp in Garissa County, Kenya, hosts nearly 340,000 refugees in
five subcamps (Dagahaley, Hagadera, Ifo, Ifo2, and Kambioos) (1). On November 18 
and 19, 2015, during an ongoing national cholera outbreak (2), two camp residents
were evaluated for acute watery diarrhea (three or more stools in ≤24 hours);
Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 serotype Ogawa was isolated from stool specimens
collected from both patients. Within 1 week of the report of index cases, an
additional 45 cases of acute watery diarrhea were reported. The United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees and their health-sector partners coordinated the
cholera response, community outreach and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
activities; Médecins Sans Frontiéres and the International Rescue Committee were 
involved in management of cholera treatment centers; CDC performed laboratory
confirmation of cases and undertook GIS mapping and postoutbreak response
assessment; and the Garissa County Government and the Kenya Ministry of Health
conducted a case-control study. To prevent future cholera outbreaks, improvements
to WASH and enhanced disease surveillance systems in Dadaab camp and the
surrounding area are needed.

Grasslands are one of the world's most extensive terrestrial biomes and are
central to the survival of herders, their livestock and diverse communities of
large wild mammals1-3. In Africa, tropical soils are predominantly
nutrient-limited4-6 but productive grassy patches in wooded grassland savannah
ecosystems2,4 grow on fertile soils created by geologic and edaphic factors,
megafauna, fire and termites4-6. Mobile pastoralists also create soil-fertility
hotspots by penning their herds at night, which concentrates excrement-and thus
nutrients-from grazing of the surrounding savannahs7-11. Historical anthropogenic
hotspots produce high-quality forage, attract wildlife and increase spatial
heterogeneity in African savannahs4,12-15. Archaeological research suggests this 
effect extends back at least 1,000 years16-19 but little is known about nutrient 
persistence at millennial scales. Here we use chemical, isotopic and sedimentary 
analyses to show high nutrient and 15N enrichment in on-site degraded dung
deposits relative to off-site soils at five Pastoral Neolithic20 sites
(radiocarbon dated to between 3,700 and 1,550 calibrated years before present
(cal. BP)). This study demonstrates the longevity of nutrient hotspots and the
long-term legacy of ancient herders, whose settlements enriched and diversified
African savannah landscapes over three millennia.

Aflatoxin M₁ (AFM₁), a human carcinogen, is found in milk products and may have
potentially severe health impacts on milk consumers. We assessed the risk of
cancer and stunting as a result of AFM₁ consumption in Nairobi, Kenya, using
worst case assumptions of toxicity and data from previous studies. Almost all
(99.5%) milk was contaminated with AFM₁. Cancer risk caused by AFM₁ was lower
among consumers purchasing from formal markets (0.003 cases per 100,000) than for
low-income consumers (0.006 cases per 100,000) purchasing from informal markets. 
Overall cancer risk (0.004 cases per 100,000) from AFM₁ alone was low. Stunting
is multifactorial, but assuming only AFM₁ consumption was the determinant,
consumption of milk contaminated with AFM₁ levels found in this study could
contribute to 2.1% of children below three years in middle-income families, and
2.4% in low-income families, being stunted. Overall, 2.7% of children could
hypothetically be stunted due to AFM₁ exposure from milk. Based on our results
AFM₁ levels found in milk could contribute to an average of -0.340 height for age
z-score reduction in growth. The exposure to AFM₁ from milk is 46 ng/day on
average, but children bear higher exposure of 3.5 ng/kg bodyweight (bw)/day
compared to adults, at 0.8 ng/kg bw/day. Our paper shows that concern over
aflatoxins in milk in Nairobi is disproportionate if only risk of cancer is
considered, but that the effect on stunting children might be much more
significant from a public health perspective; however, there is still
insufficient data on the health effects of AFM₁.

BACKGROUND: Person-centered care during childbirth is recognized as a critical
component of quality of maternity care. But there are few validated tools to
measure person-centered maternity care (PCMC). This paper aims to fill this
measurement gap. We present the results of the psychometric analysis of the PCMC 
tool that was previously validated in Kenya using data from India. We aim to
assess the validity and reliability of the PCMC scale in India, and to compare
the results to those found in the Kenya validation.
METHODS: We use data from a cross-sectional survey conducted from August to
October 2017 with recently delivered women at 40 government facilities in Uttar
Pradesh, India (N = 2018). The PCMC measure used is a previously validated scale 
with subscales for dignity and respect, communication and autonomy, and
supportive care. We performed psychometric analyses, including iterative
exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, to assess construct and criterion
validity and reliability.
RESULTS: The results provide support for a 27-item PCMC scale in India with a
possible score range from 0 to 81, compared to the 30-item PCMC scale in Kenya
with a 0 to 90 possible score range. The overall PCMC scale has good reliability 
(Cronbach alpha = 0.85). Similar to Kenya, we are able to group the items in to
three conceptual domains representing subscales for "Dignity and Respect,"
"Communication and Autonomy," and "Supportive Care." The sub-scales also have
relatively good reliability (Cronbach alphas range from 0.67 to 0.73). In
addition, increasing scores on the scale is associated with future intentions to 
deliver in the same facility, suggesting good criterion validity.
CONCLUSIONS: This research extends the PCMC literature by presenting results of
validating the PCMC scale in a new context. The psychometric analysis using data 
from Uttar Pradesh, India corroborates the Kenya analysis showing the scale had
good content, construct, and criterion validity, as well as high reliability. The
overlap in items suggests that this scale can be used across different contexts
to compare women's experiences of care, and to inform and evaluate quality
improvement efforts to promote comprehensive PCMC.

BACKGROUND: Suicide accounts for approximately 1.4% of deaths globally and is the
15th leading cause of death overall. There are no reliable data on the
epidemiology of completed suicide in rural areas of many developing countries,
yet suicide is an indicator of the sustainable development goals on health.
METHODS: Using data collected between 2008 and 2016 from the Kilifi Health and
Demographic Surveillance System in rural Kenya, we retrospectively determined the
incidence rate and risk factors for completed suicide.
RESULTS: During the period, 104 people died by suicide, contributing to 0.78%
(95% CI = 0.74-1.10) of all deaths. The mean annual incidence rate of suicide was
4.61 (95% CI = 3.80-5.58) per 100,000 person years of observation (pyo). The
annual incidence rate for men was higher than that of women (IRR = 3.05, 95%
CI = 1.98-4.70, p < 0.001) and it increased with age (IRR = 2.73, 95%
CI = 2.30-3.24, p < 0.001). People aged > 64 years had the highest mean incidence
rate of 18.58 (95% CI = 11.99-28.80) per 100,000 pyo. Completed suicide was
associated with age, being male, and living in a house whose wall is made of
scrap material, which is a proxy marker of extreme poverty in this region
(OR = 5.5, 95% CI = 4.0-7.0, p = 0.02). Most cases (76%) completed suicide by
hanging themselves. Spatial heterogeneity of rates of suicides was observed
across the enumeration zones of the KHDSS.
CONCLUSIONS: Suicide is common in this area, but the incidence of completed
suicide in rural Kenya may be an underestimate of the true burden. Like in other 
studies, suicide was associated with older age, being male and poverty, but other
medical and neuropsychiatric risk factors should be investigated in future
studies.

We conducted an exploratory analysis of former HIV Prevention Trials Network 052 
(HPTN 052) clinical trial participants in 2016 to assess their (1) satisfaction
with the HPTN 052 clinical trial care and treatment, and reasons for joining the 
trial; and (2) perspectives about the post-trial transition to public HIV care
centers. Quantitative data showed that, of the 70 survey participants, 94.3%
(n = 66) reported being very satisfied with the care and treatment they received 
while participating in the clinical trial and 51.4% (n = 36) reported they joined
the study because they would receive information to improve their own or their
partner's health. Qualitative data (five in-depth interviews and two focus group 
discussions) analysis revealed the following themes: transition experiences;
perceived superior clinical trial care; study benefits not offered at public HIV 
care centers; and the public HIV care centers' indifference to the uninfected
partner. For some HPTN 052 participants, transition to HIV care clinics was
disappointing. Clinical trial investigators and local Institutional Review Boards
should consider the need for safeguards and oversight of post-trial health care
for trial participants after the trial ends, especially in resource-constrained
settings, to avoid negative health outcomes.

Stillbirth in the African Great Lakes region: A pooled analysis of Demographic
and Health Surveys.

New South Wales, Australia.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the rate and predisposing
factors associated with stillbirth in the African Great Lakes region (Burundi,
Congo Democratic Republic, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cross-sectional data from the most recent Demographic and
Health Surveys (DHS) of countries in the African Great Lakes region were used in 
this study. DHS from Congo Democratic Republic was not included in the analyses
because data was not collected for stillbirth in the country survey. A pooled
sample of 57046 pregnancies of 7+ months' duration and 1002 stillbirths were
included in the final analysis. The analyses were restricted to stillbirths
reported in the 5 years preceding the surveys. Stillbirth was defined as foetal
death in the third trimester (≥ 28 weeks' gestation). Multilevel logistic
regression analyses that adjusted for cluster and survey weights were used to
determine the factors associated with stillbirth in the Africa Great Lakes
region. Health service variables and maternal medical condition variables were
not included in the analysis because DHS do not collect data on these variables
for pregnancies that did not result in a live birth. Burundi had the highest
stillbirth rate per 1000 births [23% (95% CI: 20, 25)] within the region. Factors
associated with stillbirth across the region were: no schooling [1.85 (95%Cl:
1.44, 2.38)] and primary education [1.64 (1.32, 2.05)], advanced maternal age
[2.39 (95% CI: 1.59, 3.59)], smoking [1.99 (95% CI: 1.19, 3.32)] and drinking
water from unimproved sources [1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.37)].
CONCLUSION: To achieve Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) stillbirth target of 12
per 1000 births or less by 2030, policy interventions to prevent stillbirth
should focus on promoting community-based socio-educational programmes which
encourages a healthy lifestyle especially among uneducated women in the advanced 
age spectrum.

When predators are removed or suppressed for generations, prey populations tend
to increase and when predators are re-introduced, prey densities should fall back
to pre-control levels. In cases of apparent competition where there are alternate
abundant and rare prey species, rare species may decline further than expected or
disappear altogether. Recently, concern about the impact of recovering predator
populations on wildlife in Laikipia County, Kenya, has led to questions of
whether lions (Panthera leo, IUCN Red List Vulnerable) exert top-down pressure on
Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi, IUCN Red List Endangered). We examined effects of
lion predation on Plain's zebra (E. quagga, IUCN Red List Near Threatened) and
Grevy's zebra populations in a 2,105 km2 area defined by lion movements. We used 
line transect surveys to estimate density of Grevy's (0.71/km2) and Plain's
(15.9/km2) zebras, and satellite telemetry to measure movements for lions and
both zebras. We tracked lions to potential feeding sites to estimate predation
rates on zebras. We compared field-based estimates of predation rates on both
zebras to random gas models of encounters that result in predation to ask if
lions prey preferentially on Grevy's zebra at a sufficient rate to drive
population declines. Lions preyed on Grevy's zebra significantly less than
expected in 15 of 16 (94%) scenarios considered and lions preyed on Plain's
zebras as expected or significantly less than expected in 15 of 16 scenarios.
Population trend of Grevy's zebra indicates that the Kenya population may be
stabilizing. Recruitment rate to the population has tripled since 2004, making it
unlikely that lions are having an impact on Grevy's zebras. In Laikipia County,
competitive displacement by livestock (Livestock: Grevy's zebra ratio = 864:1)
and interference competition for grass with Plain's zebra (Plain's zebra:Grevy's 
zebra ratio = 22:1) are most likely the predominant threats to Grevy's Zebra
recovery.

Nairobi, Kenya.

Background: Female genital mutilation (FGM) is one of the most harmful traditions
still practiced in many parts of the developing world, including Kenya. The
practice leads to permanent and irreversible health damages; however, knowledge
and attitude of women towards its obstetric effects is scarce.
Aim: The objective of this study was to determine knowledge and attitude of women
towards obstetric effects of FGM among Maasai women.
Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Loitokitok
Sub-County Hospital among 64 Maasai women who had undergone FGM. Systematic
sampling was employed to identify the respondents. Data were collected using a
pretested semistructured questionnaire and analyzed through Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 based on frequencies and percentages.
Qualitative data were coded and categorized and thematic analysis was done.
Results: Half of the women were knowledgeable on obstetric effects of FGM.
Majority of them, 81% (n=52), sustained perineal tears during childbirth while
53% (n=34) had postpartum hemorrhage. Majority of the respondents, 81% (n=51),
had negative attitude towards FGM and 87% (n=31) would not encourage their
daughters to be circumcised. Most of them, 64% (n=23), disagreed that
circumcision made one a respectable woman.
Conclusion: Obstetric effects of FGM were fairly known and there was negative
attitude towards FGM practice.

Newcastle disease (ND) is a serious disease of poultry that causes significant
economic losses. Despite rampant ND outbreaks that occur annually in Kenya, the
information about the NDV circulating in Kenya is still scarce. We report the
first countrywide study of NDV in Kenya. Our study is aimed at evaluating the
genetic characteristics of Newcastle disease viruses obtained from backyard
poultry in farms and live bird markets in different regions of Kenya. We
sequenced and analyzed fusion (F) protein gene, including the cleavage site, of
the obtained viruses. We aligned and compared study sequences with representative
NDV of different genotypes from GenBank. The fusion protein cleavage site of all 
the study sequences had the motif 112RRQKRFV118 indicating their velogenic
nature. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the NDV from various sites in Kenya
was highly similar genetically and that it clustered together with NDV of
genotype V. The study samples were 96% similar to previous Ugandan and Kenyan
viruses grouped in subgenotype Vd This study points to possible circulation of
NDV of similar genetic characteristics between backyard poultry farms and live
bird markets in Kenya. The study also suggests the possible spread of velogenic
NDV between Kenya and Uganda possibly through cross-border live bird trade. Our
study provides baseline information on the genetic characteristics of NDV
circulating in the Kenyan poultry population. This highlights the need for the ND
control programmes to place more stringent measures on cross-border trade of live
bird markets and poultry products to prevent the introduction of new strains of
NDV that would otherwise be more difficult to control.

Harvesting of wild populations can cause the evolution of morphological,
behavioral, and life history traits that may compromise natural or sexual
selection. Despite the vulnerability of large mammals to rapid population decline
from harvesting, the evolutionary effects of harvesting on mega-fauna have
received limited attention. In elephants, illegal ivory harvesting
disproportionately affects older age classes and males because they carry large
tusks, but its' effects on tusk size for age or tusk size for stature are less
understood. We tested whether severe historical elephant harvests eliminated
large tuskers among survivors and whether elephants born thereafter had smaller
tusks. Adjusting for the influence of shoulder height - a metric strongly
correlated with body size and age and often used as a proxy for age - we compared
tusk size for elephants sampled in 1966-1968, prior to severe ivory harvesting in
the late 1970s and early 1980s, with tusk size of survivors and elephants born
during population recovery in the mid-1990s. In a regional population, tusk
length declined by ˜21% in male and by ˜27% in female elephants born during
population recovery, while tusk length declined by 22% in males and 37% in
females among survivors. Tusk circumference at lip declined by 5% in males but
not in females born during population recovery, whereas tusk circumference
reduced by 8% in male and by 11% in female survivors. In a single subpopulation, 
mean tusk length at mean basal tusk circumference declined by 12.4% in males and 
21% in females. Tusk size varied between elephant social groups. Tusk homogeneity
within social groups and the often high genetic similarity within social groups
suggest that tusk size may be heritable. Our findings support a hypothesis of
selection of large tuskers by poachers as a driver of the decline in tusk size
for age proxy and contemporary tusk evolution in African elephants.

Cryptococcus neoformans is an important opportunistic pathogen causing focal or
disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients.1 Most common sites of
involvement include central nervous system, skin and lungs. Hepatobiliary
involvement with hepatitis or cholangitis as the initial manifestation of
cryptococcosis has been reported rarely.2 In patients with acquired
immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS), cryptococcosis of the liver has been reported
in 1-13% of patients.3 Occasional cases of hepatobiliary cryptococcosis as a part
of disseminated infection in HIV-negative patients are also present in the
literature.4 In most of the reported cases of hepatobiliary involvement,
diagnosis of cryptococcosis has been rendered on tissue biopsies. Extensive
review of the literature revealed only one report of cytologic diagnosis of
biliary cryptococcosis on fine needle aspiration of a mass in the common bile
duct in an immunocompromised patient.5 Hence, the cytologic literature of
hepatobiliary cryptococcosis is very limited at present. This article is

Access to comprehensive reproductive health care for women and girls, including
access to quality maternal health services remains a challenge in Kenya. A recent
government enquiry assessing close to 500 maternal deaths that occurred in 2014
revealed gaps in the quality of maternal care, concluding that more than 90% of
the women who had died had received "suboptimal" maternal care. In Kenya, the
Center for Reproductive Rights (the Center) has undertaken public interest
litigation among other strategies to challenge human rights violations and
systematic failures within the health sector. In 2014, before the High Court of
Bungoma in Western Kenya, the Center filed a case on behalf of Josephine Majani
who had been neglected and abused by the staff of the Bungoma County Referral
Hospital, a public health facility where she had gone to deliver in 2013. This
commentary addresses the situation of maternal health care in Kenya and the
actions leading to litigation that was specifically aimed at enabling access to
quality maternal health care. It provides an analysis of some of the outcomes of 
the litigation and highlights the implications thereof on implementation of
maternal health care in Kenya and beyond.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to describe the development of an
evidence-based care pathway that can be implemented globally.
METHODS: The Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI) care pathway development team
extracted interventions recommended for the management of spinal disorders from
six GSCI articles that synthesized the available evidence from guidelines and
relevant literature. Sixty-eight international and interprofessional clinicians
and scientists with expertise in spine-related conditions were invited to
participate. An iterative consensus process was used.
RESULTS: After three rounds of review, 46 experts from 16 countries reached
consensus for the care pathway that includes five decision steps: awareness,
initial triage, provider assessment, interventions (e.g., non-invasive treatment;
invasive treatment; psychological and social intervention; prevention and public 
health; specialty care and interprofessional management), and outcomes. The care 
pathway can be used to guide the management of patients with any spine-related
concern (e.g., back and neck pain, deformity, spinal injury, neurological
conditions, pathology, spinal diseases). The pathway is simple and can be
incorporated into educational tools, decision-making trees, and electronic
medical records.
CONCLUSION: A care pathway for the management of individuals presenting with
spine-related concerns includes evidence-based recommendations to guide health
care providers in the management of common spinal disorders. The proposed pathway
is person-centered and evidence-based. The acceptability and utility of this care
pathway will need to be evaluated in various communities, especially in low- and 
middle-income countries, with different cultural background and resources. These 
slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

PURPOSE: Spinal disorders, including back and neck pain, are major causes of
disability, economic hardship, and morbidity, especially in underserved
communities and low- and middle-income countries. Currently, there is no model of
care to address this issue. This paper provides an overview of the papers from
the Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI), which was convened to develop an
evidence-based, practical, and sustainable, spinal healthcare model for
communities around the world with various levels of resources.
METHODS: Leading spine clinicians and scientists around the world were invited to
participate. The interprofessional, international team consisted of 68 members
from 24 countries, representing most disciplines that study or care for patients 
with spinal symptoms, including family physicians, spine surgeons,
rheumatologists, chiropractors, physical therapists, epidemiologists, research
methodologists, and other stakeholders.
RESULTS: Literature reviews on the burden of spinal disorders and six categories 
of evidence-based interventions for spinal disorders (assessment, public health, 
psychosocial, noninvasive, invasive, and the management of osteoporosis) were
completed. In addition, participants developed a stratification system for
surgical intervention, a classification system for spinal disorders, an
evidence-based care pathway, and lists of resources and recommendations to
implement the GSCI model of care.
CONCLUSION: The GSCI proposes an evidence-based model that is consistent with
recent calls for action to reduce the global burden of spinal disorders. The
model requires testing to determine feasibility. If it proves to be
implementable, this model holds great promise to reduce the tremendous global
burden of spinal disorders. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic

PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to describe the Global Spine Care
Initiative (GSCI) contributors, disclosures, and methods for reporting
transparency on the development of the recommendations.
METHODS: World Spine Care convened the GSCI to develop an evidence-based,
practical, and sustainable healthcare model for spinal care. The initiative aims 
to improve the management, prevention, and public health for spine-related
disorders worldwide; thus, global representation was essential. A series of
meetings established the initiative's mission and goals. Electronic surveys
collected contributorship and demographic information, and experiences with
spinal conditions to better understand perceptions and potential biases that were
contributing to the model of care.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight clinicians and scientists participated in the deliberations 
and are authors of one or more of the GSCI articles. Of these experts, 57
reported providing spine care in 34 countries, (i.e., low-, middle-, and
high-income countries, as well as underserved communities in high-income
countries.) The majority reported personally experiencing or having a close
family member with one or more spinal concerns including: spine-related trauma or
injury, spinal problems that required emergency or surgical intervention, spinal 
pain referred from non-spine sources, spinal deformity, spinal pathology or
disease, neurological problems, and/or mild, moderate, or severe back or neck
pain. There were no substantial reported conflicts of interest.
CONCLUSION: The GSCI participants have broad professional experience and wide
international distribution with no discipline dominating the deliberations. The
GSCI believes this set of papers has the potential to inform and improve spine
care globally. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary
Material.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to describe the development of a
classification system that would apply to anyone with a spine-related concern and
that can be used in an evidence-based spine care pathway.
METHODS: Existing classification systems for spinal disorders were assembled. A
seed document was developed through round-table discussions followed by a
modified Delphi process. International and interprofessional clinicians and
scientists with expertise in spine-related conditions were invited to
participate.
RESULTS: Thirty-six experts from 15 countries participated. After the second
round, there was 95% agreement of the proposed classification system. The six
major classifications included: no or minimal symptoms (class 0); mild symptoms
(i.e., neck or back pain) but no interference with activities (class I); moderate
or severe symptoms with interference of activities (class II); spine-related
neurological signs or symptoms (class III); severe bony spine deformity, trauma
or pathology (class IV); and spine-related symptoms or destructive lesions
associated with systemic pathology (class V). Subclasses for each major class
included chronicity and severity when different interventions were anticipated or
recommended.
CONCLUSIONS: An international and interprofessional group developed a
comprehensive classification system for all potential presentations of people who
may seek care or advice at a spine care program. This classification can be used 
in the development of a spine care pathway, in clinical practice, and for
research purposes. This classification needs to be tested for validity,
reliability, and consistency among clinicians from different specialties and in
different communities and cultures. These slides can be retrieved under
Electronic Supplementary Material.

PURPOSE: Spine-related disorders are a leading cause of global disability and are
a burden on society and to public health. Currently, there is no comprehensive,
evidence-based model of care for spine-related disorders, which includes back and
neck pain, deformity, spine injury, neurological conditions, spinal diseases, and
pathology, that could be applied in global health care settings. The purposes of 
this paper are to propose: (1) principles to transform the delivery of spine
care; (2) an evidence-based model that could be applied globally; and (3)
implementation suggestions.
METHODS: The Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI) meetings and literature reviews 
were synthesized into a seed document and distributed to spine care experts.
After three rounds of a modified Delphi process, all participants reached
consensus on the final model of care and implementation steps.
RESULTS: Sixty-six experts representing 24 countries participated. The GSCI model
of care has eight core principles: person-centered, people-centered,
biopsychosocial, proactive, evidence-based, integrative, collaborative, and
self-sustaining. The model of care includes a classification system and care
pathway, levels of care, and a focus on the patient's journey. The six steps for 
implementation are initiation and preparation; assessment of the current
situation; planning and designing solutions; implementation; assessment and
evaluation of program; and sustain program and scale up.
CONCLUSION: The GSCI proposes an evidence-based, practical, sustainable, and
scalable model of care representing eight core principles with a six-step
implementation plan. The aim of this model is to help transform spine care
globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries and underserved
communities. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary

PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to describe the development of a list of
resources necessary to implement a model of care for the management of
spine-related concerns anywhere in the world, but especially in underserved
communities and low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: Contents from the Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI) Classification
System and GSCI care pathway papers provided a foundation for the resources list.
A seed document was developed that included resources for spine care that could
be delivered in primary, secondary and tertiary settings, as well as resources
needed for self-care and community-based settings for a wide variety of spine
concerns (e.g., back and neck pain, deformity, spine injury, neurological
conditions, pathology and spinal diseases). An iterative expert consensus process
was used using electronic surveys.
RESULTS: Thirty-five experts completed the process. An iterative consensus
process was used through an electronic survey. A consensus was reached after two 
rounds. The checklist of resources included the following categories: healthcare 
provider knowledge and skills, materials and equipment, human resources,
facilities and infrastructure. The list identifies resources needed to implement 
a spine care program in any community, which are based upon spine care needs.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first international and
interprofessional attempt to develop a list of resources needed to deliver care
in an evidence-based care pathway for the management of people presenting with
spine-related concerns. This resource list needs to be field tested in a variety 
of communities with different resource capacities to verify its utility. These
slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

Animal model systems for human and animal influenza virus infection and
transmission have been established to address research questions which cannot be 
addressed using in vitro models. Several animal models have been established,
such as mice, guinea pig, ferret, pig, poultry, nonhuman primates, and others.
Each animal model has its own strength and weaknesses, which should be taken into
consideration to select the appropriate animal model to use. This chapter will
describe standard protocols relevant for in vivo experiment, including procedures
required prior to the start of the animal experiment and sample processing. The
animal models described in this chapter are mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, pigs, and
chickens.

Living on the edge: Multiscale habitat selection by cheetahs in a human-wildlife 
landscape.

Animals select habitats that will ultimately optimize their fitness through
access to favorable resources, such as food, mates, and breeding sites. However, 
access to these resources may be limited by bottom-up effects, such as
availability, and top-down effects, such as risk avoidance and competition,
including that with humans. Competition between wildlife and people over
resources, specifically over space, has played a significant role in the
worldwide decrease in large carnivores. The goal of this study was to determine
the habitat selection of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in a human-wildlife
landscape at multiple spatial scales. Cheetahs are a wide-ranging, large
carnivore, whose significant decline is largely attributed to habitat loss and
fragmentation. It is believed that 77% of the global cheetah population ranges
outside protected areas, yet little is known about cheetahs' resource use in
areas where they co-occur with people. The selection, or avoidance, of three
anthropogenic variables (human footprint density, distance to main roads and
wildlife areas) and five environmental variables (open habitat, semiclosed
habitat, edge density, patch density and slope), at multiple spatial scales, was 
determined by analyzing collar data from six cheetahs. Cheetahs selected
variables at different scales; anthropogenic variables were selected at broader
scales (720-1440 m) than environmental variables (90-180 m), suggesting that
anthropogenic pressures affect habitat selection at a home-range level, whilst
environmental variables influence site-level habitat selection. Cheetah presence 
was best explained by human presence, wildlife areas, semiclosed habitat, edge
density and slope. Cheetahs showed avoidance for humans and steep slopes and
selected for wildlife areas and areas with high proportions of semiclosed habitat
and edge density. Understanding a species' resource requirements, and how these
might be affected by humans, is crucial for conservation. Using a multiscale
approach, we provide new insights into the habitat selection of a large carnivore
living in a human-wildlife landscape.

The microbial larvicides Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis and Bacillus
sphaericus have been used extensively for mosquito control and have been found to
be effective and safe to non-target organisms cohabiting with mosquito larvae.
Recently developed long lasting microbial larvicides (LLML), although evading the
previous challenge of short duration of activity, increase the risk of
persistence of toxins in the treated larval habitats. This study monitored the
impact of LLML FourStar® and LL3 on non-target organisms cohabiting with mosquito
larvae in an operational study to control malaria vectors in western Kenya
highlands. A total of 300 larval habitats were selected in three highland
villages. The habitats were first monitored for 5 weeks to collect baseline data 
on non-target organisms cohabiting with mosquito larvae and then randomized into 
two treatment arms (respective FourStar® and LL3) and one control arm. Non-target
organisms were sampled weekly for 5 months after treatment to assess the impact
of LLML intervention. Before treatment, the mean density of all non-target
organisms combined in the control, LL3 and FourStar® treated habitats was 1.42,
1.39 and 1.49 individuals per habitat per sampling occasion, respectively.
Following treatment, this density remained fairly unchanged for 21 weeks at which
time it was 1.82, 2.11, and 2.05 for the respective control, LL3 and FourStar®
treated habitats. Statistical analysis revealed that LL3 and FourStar® did not
significantly alter abundance, richness or diversity of the 11 taxa studied, when
comparing the intervention and control larval habitats. However, both FourStar®
and LL3 significantly reduced the density of malaria vectors. In conclusion, one 
round of label rate application of FourStar® or LL3 in natural larval habitats
did not alter richness, abundance or diversity of the monitored aquatic
non-target organisms cohabiting with mosquito larvae to an ecologically
significant level.

Human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma
(KS). We systematically reviewed literature published between 1998 and 2017,
according to the PRISMA guidelines, to understand the distribution of HHV-8
infection in Africa. More than two-thirds (64%) of studies reported on
seroprevalence and 29.3% on genotypes; 9.5% were on both seroprevalence and
genotypes. About 45% of African countries had data on HHV-8 seroprevalence
exclusively, and more than half (53%) had data on either seroprevalence or
genotypes. Almost half (47%) of the countries had no data on HHV-8 infection.
There was high heterogeneity in the types of tests and interpretation algorithms 
used in determining HHV-8 seropositivity across the different studies. Generally,
seroprevalence ranged from 2.0% in a group of young children in Eritrea to 100%
in a small group of individuals with KS in Central African Republic, and in a
larger group of individuals with KS in Morocco. Approximately 16% of studies
reported on children. Difference in seroprevalence across the African regions was
not significant (95% CI, χ² = 0.86; p = 0.35), although specifically a relatively
significant level of infection was observed in HIV-infected children. About 38%
of the countries had data on K1 genotypes. K1 genotypes A, A5, B, C, F and Z
occurred at frequencies of 5.3%, 26.3%, 42.1%, 18.4%, 5.3% and 2.6%,
respectively. Twenty-three percent of the countries had data for K15 genotypes,
and genotypes P, M and N occurred at frequencies of 52.2%, 39.1%, and 8.7%,
respectively. Data on HHV-8 inter-genotype recombinants in Africa are scanty.
HHV-8 may be endemic in the entire Africa continent but there is need for a
harmonized testing protocol for a better understanding of HHV-8 seropositivity.
K1 genotypes A5 and B, and K15 genotypes P and M, from Africa, should be
considered in vaccine design efforts.

BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest that higher body mass index is associated with
increased susceptibility to bacterial vaginosis (BV), but results are
conflicting.
METHODS: Female sex workers aged 16-45 and participating in an open, prospective 
cohort study in Mombasa, Kenya between 2000 and 2014 were included in this
analysis. Up to 2 years of follow-up were included per woman. Body mass index
(BMI) was categorized as underweight (≤18.5), normal (18.5-24.9), overweight
(25-29.9), and obese (≥30). Bacterial vaginosis was assessed using Nugent scores.
Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate relative risks of the
association between BMI and BV.
RESULTS: At baseline, 32.1% (n=625) of 1,946 women had BV. Half of women were
overweight (31.1%, n=606) or obese (20.1%, n=391). Participants contributed
14,319 follow-up visits. Adjusting for age, compared to women with normal BMI,
overweight (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 0.91, 95%CI 0.81-1.02) and obese (aRR
0.82, 95%CI 0.71-0.94) women were at lower risk for BV (joint p-value=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Obese women had a nearly 20% lower risk of BV compared to women with
normal BMI. Potential mechanisms for this effect, including possible effects of
diet, obesity-associated changes in the gut microbiome, and systemic estrogen
levels, should be explored.

BACKGROUND: In Kenya, HIV testing during first ANC visit is standard practice for
pregnant women. Despite a policy promoting male partner testing in ANC, few male 
partners accompany their partners for HIV testing. We evaluated the impact of
using oral HIV self-testing on HIV testing among male partners of ANC clients in 
Kenya.
METHODS: In a three-arm randomized control study in Eastern and Central Kenya,
consenting women attending first ANC visit were randomized to receive: 1)
standard-of-care and a standard information card; 2) an improved card stating the
importance of male HIV testing; 3) two oral HIV self-test kits and HIV testing
information. Women completed a baseline and endline questionnaire and consenting 
male partners were surveyed three months after enrolling female ANC clients. The 
primary outcome was male partner HIV testing as reported by their female
partners.
RESULTS: We randomized 1,410 women at their first ANC visit out of which 1,215
were successfully followed up. 1,133 male partners consented to the survey. In
the self-testing study arm 3, 79.4% (335/422) of the women reported that their
partner tested for HIV compared to 28% (114/406) and 37% (142/387) in study arm 1
and study arm 2, respectively. Over 90% of male partners who used the oral HIV
self-test kits reported it was easy to take sample and read the test results.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that the ANC platform offers a unique
opportunity to increase HIV testing among men using self-testing through
distribution by their female partnersThis is an open-access article distributed

Hill, NC, USA.

Background: The advent of new technological approaches to family planning has the
potential to address unmet need in low- and middle-income countries. Provision of
fertility awareness-based apps have the ability to provide accessible,
direct-to-user fertility information to help women achieve their reproductive
goals. The CycleBeads app, a digital platform for the Standard Days Method (SDM),
a modern method of family planning, helps women achieve or prevent pregnancy, or 
track their cycles using the only their period start dates.
Methods: Brief social marketing campaigns were launched by the app developer to
monitor cost and distribution of the CycleBeads app, understand the user profile,
and assess user experience. Monitoring and evaluation through in-app micro
surveys occurred over a 6-cycle period in seven countries: Egypt, Ghana, India,
Jordan, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda. In-app micro-surveys were utilized to collect
data around demographics, mode of use of the app, prior experiences with family
planning, and satisfaction to better understand women's interactions with the
apps, and the possibility for meeting unmet need. Analyzes focused on women who
were using the app to prevent pregnancy or track their cycles.
Results: Social media campaigns proved to be an easy, low-cost approach to
advertising the CycleBeads app. As a result, 356,520 women downloaded the app,
and the cost to the advertiser per download ranged from $0.17-0.69. A majority of
app users were between 20-29 years old, married or in exclusive relationships.
Overall, 39.9% of users were using the app to prevent pregnancy, 38.5% to plan a 
pregnancy, and 21.6% were tracking their cycles. Among the users preventing
pregnancy, 64.1% of women had not used a family planning method 3 months before
downloading the CycleBeads app. One-third of users who were using the app to
track their cycles, reported that they had not been using any form of family
planning. In all seven countries, nearly 60% of women reported that they would
definitely recommend the CycleBeads app to a friend, indicating their
satisfaction with the app.
Conclusions: Our main findings indicate that a social media campaign is a
low-cost approach to making the CycleBeads app accessible to women. The app
addresses multiple reproductive intentions and attracts a diverse demographic of 
users across different life stages. For many women the app was the first modern
method they used in the last 3 months, showing that fertility awareness-based
apps have the potential to address an unmet need. Future studies should focus on 
changes in behavior during the fertile window, partner communication, and future 
family planning intentions.

Introduction: Despite an estimated one-third of the global burden of disease
being surgical, only limited estimates of accessibility to surgical treatment in 
sub-Saharan Africa exist and these remain spatially undefined. Geographical
metrics of access to major hospitals were estimated based on travel time.
Estimates were then used to assess need for surgery at country level.
Methods: Major district and regional hospitals were assumed to have capability to
perform bellwether procedures. Geographical locations of hospitals in relation to
the population in the 47 sub-Saharan countries were combined with spatial
ancillary data on roads, elevation, land use or land cover to estimate
travel-time metrics of 30 min, 1 hour and 2 hours. Hospital catchment was defined
as population residing in areas less than 2 hours of travel time to the next
major hospital. Travel-time metrics were combined with fine-scale population maps
to define burden of surgery at hospital catchment level.
Results: Overall, the majority of the population (92.5%) in sub-Saharan Africa
reside in areas within 2 hours of a major hospital catchment defined based on
spatially defined travel times. The burden of surgery in all-age population was
257.8 million to 294.7 million people and was highest in high-population density 
countries and lowest in sparsely populated or smaller countries. The estimated
burden in children <15 years was 115.3 million to 131.8 million and had similar
spatial distribution to the all-age pattern.
Conclusion: The study provides an assessment of accessibility and burden of
surgical disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet given the optimistic assumption of
adequare surgical capability of major hospitals, the true burden of surgical
disease is expected to be much greater. In-depth health facility assessments are 
needed to define infrastructure, personnel and medicine supply for delivering
timely and safe affordable surgery to further inform the analysis.

Vector control and effective case management are currently the backbone
strategies of malaria control. Kitgum district, an area of perennial holoendemic 
malaria transmission intensity in Northern Uganda, appears to have experienced a 
malaria epidemic in 2015. This study aimed to describe the malaria trends in
Kitgum General Hospital from 2011-2017 in relation to climatic factors and the
application of population-based malaria control interventions. Hospital records
were examined retrospectively to calculate malaria normal channels, malaria cases
per 1000 population, test positivity rates (TPR) and to enumerate pregnancy
malaria, hospitalizations and deaths. Climatic factors (humidity, temperature and
rainfall) and population-based malaria control interventions that had been
applied during this period were described. Kitgum district experienced an
epidemic between the years 2015 and 2016; the malaria burden rose above the
established normal channels. At its peak the number of malaria cases attending
KGH was over 20 times above the normal channels. The total number of cases per
1000 population increased from 7 in 2014 to 113 in 2015 and 114 in 2016 (p value 
for trend <0.0001). Similarly, TPR increased from 10.5% to 54.6% between 2014 and
2016 (p value for trend <0.0001). This trend was also observed for malaria
attributable hospitalizations, and malaria in pregnancy. There were no
significant changes in any of the climatic factors assessed (p value = 0.92,
0.99, 0.52 for relative humidity, max temperature, and rainfall, respectively).
The malaria upsurge occurred in conjunction with a general decline in the use and
application of malaria control interventions. Specifically, indoor residual
spraying was interrupted in 2014. In response to the epidemic, IRS was reapplied 
together with mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) 
in 2017. Subsequently, there was a decline in all malaria indicators. The
epidemic in Kitgum occurred in association with the interruption of IRS and
appears to have abated following its re-introduction alongside LLINs. The study
suggests that to enable malaria elimination in areas of high malaria transmission
intensity, effective control measures may need to be sustained for the long-term.

BACKGROUND: Schistosoma haematobium infection in endemic areas varies depending
on the nature and complexity of the transmission networks present. Studies of
micro-geographical transmission of S. haematobium infection indicate that
discrepancy in prevalence between households is associated with diverse water
contact behaviors and transmission that is restricted to particular sites
harboring snail intermediate hosts. Detection of variations in the transmission
sources with complex transmission networks of water bodies is required for
optimization of malacological control. Longitudinal parasitological and
malacological surveys were conducted to investigate geographical variations in
transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis in Ikingwamanoti village, Shinyanga
District, Tanzania.
METHODS: Urine samples were collected at baseline and follow-up time points from 
282 school-aged children and examined microscopically for the presence of S.
haematobium eggs. Malacological surveys involved collection of Bulinus nasutus
every month from 30 sites. Snails were examined for patent infections. Global
positioning system was used to map household distances from S. haematobium
transmission sites, while water contact behavior was assessed using a
questionnaire.
RESULTS: Schistosoma haematobium infection was observed to be prevalent among
older children (12-14 years) compared to younger groups prior to treatment, but
no significant difference in infection prevalence was observed at one-year. Boys 
were highly infected than girls at both time points. No spatial influence was
observed between children's infection and the distance from child's residence to 
the nearby snail habitats nor was any significant association observed between
children's reported water contact behavior with S. haematobium infection.
However, malacological surveys with cercarial shedding combined with GPS data
detected significant variation among different water sources in the transmission 
of S. haematobium with children living in households near to ponds with high B.
nasutus populations having the highest prevalence of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Interaction between malacological surveys with cercarial shedding
combined with GPS mapping in endemic settings can help detection of transmission 
sources even in areas with complex transmission networks. Subsequent studies are 
needed to determine whether the combination of GPS mapping and parasitology
screens can aid the detection of transmission hotspots across varied transmission
settings to enhance schistosomiasis control programmes.

Pesticide residues in honey and pollen from Seychelles against a target of 108
pesticides using LC-MS/MS were analyzed. Fifteen pesticides were detected, at
trace levels (< 15 ppb) and below the acceptable maximum residue limits (MRLs) as
per EU regulations. In honey, six insecticide and three fungicide residues were
detected. Eight insecticide and four fungicide residues were detected in the
pollen matrix. The least contaminated honey and pollen samples had three and nine
chemical residues respectively while the most contaminated honey and pollen
samples had eight and eleven chemical residues respectively. Contact and oral
LD50 values were used to calculate Pollen Hazard Quotients (PHQ) = concentration 
in ppb ÷ LD50 as µg/bee. The pollen hazard quotients (PHQ) obtained are way below
those reported in literature. Residues were detected in low quantities, however, 
their high frequency and diversity and possible synergistic interactions may lead
to negative impact on honeybees' health in Seychelles.

In Kenya, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for 27% of all deaths. Adult
Kenyans have an 18% chance of dying prematurely from cancers, diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases or chronic respiratory diseases. A Novartis Access
Initiative is making medicines available to treat cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and breast cancer in 30 countries,
including Kenya. Little is known about patients' perceptions of access to
medicines for NCDs in Kenya. The study objective was to understand patients'
perceptions of access to medicines; as well as barriers and facilitators at the
household, community, and healthcare system level. A baseline qualitative study
was conducted in eight of 47 counties as part of an evaluation of the Novartis
Access Initiative in Kenya. The 84 patients interviewed through a household
survey had been diagnosed and treated for an NCD. Although medicines at
government facilities were free or cheaper than those sold in private pharmacies,
the availability of medicines presented a constant challenge. Patients often
resorted to private pharmacies, where NCD medicines cost more than at public
facilities. Participants with an NCD took their health seriously and strove to
get the medicines, even under difficult circumstances. Buying NCD medicines put a
strain on the household budget, especially for the lower-income participants.
Some actions to overcome affordability barriers included: borrowing money,
selling assets, seeking help from relatives, taking on extra work, buying partial
dosages, leaving without the medicines, or resorting to non-medical alternatives.
In conclusion, access to NCD medicines is a major challenge for most adults in
Kenya. As a result, they engage in complex interactions between public, private
facilities and pharmacies to overcome the barriers. The government should ensure 
well-stocked public sector pharmacies and subsidize prices of medicines for
lower-income patients. Integration of industry-led access to medicine programs
may help governments to obtain low cost supplies.

This paper presents findings of an experimental investigation on sodium sulphate 
(Na2SO4) activated calcined clay - Portland cement blends in sulphuric acid
media. Calcined clays were blended with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) at
replacement levels of 40% 45% and 50 % by mass of OPC to make blended cement
labelled PCC40, PCC45 and PCC50 respectively. Initially, pozzolanicity and
setting time tests were conducted. Mortar prisms measuring 40 mm × 40 mm × 160 mm
were cast using 0.5M Na2SO4 solution and their compressive strengths determined
on the 2nd, 7th, 28th and 90 th day of curing. The 28th day cured mortar prisms
were subjected to porosity test. Moreover, 5 × 5 × 5 cm mortar cubes were also
prepared and their weight and strength loss was taken as a measure of their acid 
resistivity after an immersion time of 7, 14, 28, 56, 84 and 120 days in 3 % of
sulphuric acid at 23 ± 1 °C. OPC, commercial Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) and 
PCC40, PCC45 and PCC50 cement were cast using water and similarly investigated
for comparison purposes. The results obtained showed that chemically activated
cements exhibited higher pozzolanic activity, lower porosity, shorter setting
times and higher resistance to acid attack compared to non-activated cements.
However, OPC was found to be non-pozzolanic.

The role of herbivorous livestock in supporting the sustainability of the farming
systems in which they are found is complex and sometimes conflicting. In
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the integration of livestock into farming systems is
important for sustainable agriculture as the recycling of nutrients for crop
production through returns of animal manure is a central element of the dominant 
mixed crop-livestock systems. Sustainable agriculture has been widely advocated
as the main practical pathway to address the challenge of meeting the food needs 
of the rapidly growing population in SSA while safeguarding the needs of future
generations. The objective of this paper is to review the state of knowledge of
the role of herbivores in sustainable intensification of key farming systems in
SSA. The pathways to sustainable agriculture in SSA include intensification of
production and livelihood diversification. Sustainable agricultural practices in 
SSA have focused on intensification practices which aim to increase the output : 
input ratio through increasing use of inputs, introduction of new inputs or use
of existing inputs in a new way. Intensification of livestock production can
occur through increased and improved fodder availability, genetic production
gains, improved crop residue use and better nutrient recycling of manure.
Livestock deliver many 'goods' in smallholder farming systems in SSA including
improving food and nutrition security, increased recycling of organic matter and 
nutrients and the associated soil fertility amendments, adding value to crop
residues by turning them into nutrient-rich foods, income generation and animal
traction. Narratives on livestock 'bads' or negative environmental consequences
have been largely shaped by the production conditions in the Global North but
livestock production in SSA is a different story. In SSA, livestock are an
integral component of mixed farming systems and they play key roles in supporting
the livelihoods of much of the rural population. None-the-less, the environmental
consequences of livestock production on the continent cannot be ignored. To
enhance agricultural sustainability in SSA, the challenge is to optimize
livestock's role in the farming systems by maximizing livestock 'goods' while
minimizing the 'bads'. This can be through better integration of livestock into
the farming systems, efficient nutrient management systems, and provision of
necessary policy and institutional support.

BACKGROUND: Due to media reports of several deaths, consumption of unrecorded
alcohol (i.e., alcohol brewed at home) has emerged as a public health threat in
developing countries like Kenya. Empirical data on this issue, however, is
scarce. This investigation compared demographic characteristics of Kenyans who
drank recorded (regulated) and unrecorded alcohol.
METHODS: We examined all respondents who consumed alcohol in the past month
(N = 718) on the 2015 nationally representative Kenya STEPwise survey.
Descriptive statistics and bivariate logistic regression examined proportion of
respondents consuming unrecorded alcohol, and social demographic factors
associated with unrecorded alcohol consumption, respectively.
RESULTS: The sample was primarily male (86%), married (64%), middle class or
higher (64%), with an average age of 37 years. Participants reported an average
of 2.5 drinking events and 4.3 binge-drinking occasions per month. Overall, 37%
of our sample consumed unrecorded alcohol. Compared to those with incomplete
primary education or lower, individuals who completed primary education or above 
were less likely to report consuming unrecorded alcohol (OR = 0.22, 95% CI:
0.12-0.43). Compared to poorest and poor respondents, those identifying as middle
class or above were less likely to consume unrecorded alcohol (OR = 0.47, 95% CI:
0.29-.78). Current smokers (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.34-3.60) and those with higher
binge drinking occasions in the past month (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.004-1.07) were
significantly more likely to consume unrecorded alcohol.
CONCLUSION: Kenyan adults who consume unrecorded alcohol engage in more binge
drinking occasions, smoke, and have lower levels of education and socioeconomic
status. It is vital that health promotion interventions aimed at reducing
unrecorded alcohol consumption be tailored and targeted to individuals with low
socio-economic status in Kenya.

BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia and eclampsia (PE/E) are major contributors to maternal 
and neonatal deaths in developing countries, associated with 10-15% of direct
maternal deaths and nearly a quarter of stillbirths and newborn deaths, many of
which are preventable with improved care. We present results related to
WHO-recommended interventions for screening and management of PE/E during
antenatal care (ANC) and labor and delivery (L & D) from a study conducted in six
sub-Saharan African countries.
METHODS: From 2010 to 2012, cross-sectional studies which directly observed
provision of ANC and L & D services in six sub-Saharan African countries were
conducted. Results from 643 health facilities of different levels in Ethiopia
(n = 19), Kenya (n = 509), Madagascar (n = 36), Mozambique (n = 46), Rwanda
(n = 72), and Tanzania (n = 52), were combined for this analysis. While studies
were sampled separately in each country, all used standardized observation
checklists and inventory assessment tools.
RESULTS: 2920 women receiving ANC and 2689 women in L & D were observed.
Thirty-nine percent of ANC clients were asked about PE/E danger signs, and 68%
had their blood pressure (BP) taken correctly (range 48-96%). Roughly half (46%) 
underwent testing for proteinuria. Twenty-three percent of women in L & D were
asked about PE/E danger signs (range 11-34%); 77% had their BP checked upon
admission (range 59-85%); and 6% had testing for proteinuria. Twenty-five cases
of severe PE/E were observed: magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) was used in 15, not used 
in 5, and for 5 use was unknown. The availability of MgSO4 in L & D varied from
16% in Ethiopia to 100% in Mozambique.
CONCLUSIONS: Observed ANC consultations and L & D cases showed low use of
WHO-recommended practices for PE/E screening and management. Availability of
MgSO4 was low in multiple countries, though it was on the essential drug list of 
all surveyed countries. Country programs are encouraged to address gaps in
screening and management of PE/E in ANC and L & D to contribute to lower maternal
and perinatal mortality.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are valuable tools that support prudent and timely
use of antimalarial drugs, particularly if reliable microscopy is not available. 
However, the performance and reliability of these tests vary between and within
geographical regions. The present study evaluated the performance of routine
malaria RDT in Kenyan febrile patients in Busia County, Kenya. A cross sectional 
study design was employed to recruit febrile patients attending health facilities
between August and November 2016. A total of 192 febrile patients who were slide 
positive and negative were evaluated for their infection status by nested PCR and
RDTs (PfHRP2/pLDH). In addition, P. falciparum diversity of the histidine-rich
proteins 2 and 3, that influences the RDT test results were determined. All
individuals were P. falciparum positive. Among the investigated 192 febrile
patients, 76 (40%) were positive by microscopy, 101 (53%) by RDTs and 80 (42%)
were PCR positive. The performance of the CareStart™ HRP2/pLDH (pf) RDTs was
better than microscopy (Sensitivity 94%; Specificity 75%) and Nucleic acid
testing (sensitivity 95%, specificity 77%) with high negative predictive values, 
indicating the suitability of the RDT in routine practice. Specific pfhrp2/pfhrp3
deletions shown to associate with RDT false negativity was not observed. However,
high genetic diversity among pfhrp2 gene was observed. Eleven new PfHRP2 and nine
PfHRP3 repeats were observed. False positivity by microscopy and under reporting 
of infections may thus be a barrier in malaria control and elimination programs. 
The HRP2/pLDH(Pf) based RDT yet demonstrate to be an effective tool for malaria
surveillance program.

From August 2016 to June 2017, the Public Health England-Centre for Radiation
Chemical and Environmental Hazards (PHE-CRCE), collaborating centre of the WHO,
through its Radiation Hazards and Emergencies Department Emergency Response Group
has successfully supported five WHO Joint External Evaluation (JEE) missions in
the Eastern Mediterranean (Jordan, Bahrain and Tunisia) and African (Kenya, Mali)
regions. The JEE tool is the main document used by both internal and external
expert teams as a shared methodology to assess a country's capability in term of 
preparedness and response to public health threats under the International Health
Regulation. This is done by evaluating different indicators. 'Radiation
emergencies' is one of the 19 technical fields evaluated by the JEE tool and is
composed of two indicators. Each indicator is scored on a 1-5 scale, 1 being the 
lowest (no capability) and 5 being the highest (sustainable capability). These
five countries assessed by radiation experts from PHE, for their preparedness
towards radio-nuclear emergencies, were scored between 1 and 3 against the JEE
tool, with sometimes similarities in the gaps identified. Points of progress and 
course of actions were decided for each country.

BACKGROUND: Literature suggests that electronic health (eHealth) interventions
can improve the efficiency and accuracy of health service delivery and improve
health outcomes and are generally well received by patients; however, there are
limited data on provider experiences using eHealth interventions in
resource-limited settings. The HIV Infant Tracking System (HITSystem) is an
eHealth intervention designed to improve early infant diagnosis (EID) outcomes
among HIV-exposed infants.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare provider experiences with standard EID and
HITSystem implementation at 6 Kenyan hospitals and 3 laboratories. The objective 
of this study was to better understand provider experiences implementing and
using the HITSystem in order to assess facilitators and barriers that may impact 
adoption and sustainability of this eHealth intervention.
METHODS: As part of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the HITSystem, we
conducted semistructured interviews with 17 EID providers at participating
intervention and control hospitals and laboratories.
RESULTS: Providers emphasized the perceived usefulness of the HITSystem,
including improved efficiency in sample tracking and patient follow-up,
strengthened communication networks among key stakeholders, and improved capacity
to meet patient needs compared to standard EID. These advantages were realized
from an intervention that providers saw as easy to use and largely compatible
with workflow. However, supply stock outs and patient psychosocial factors
(including fear of HIV status disclosure and poverty) provided ongoing challenges
to EID service provision. Furthermore, slow or sporadic internet access and heavy
workload prevented real-time HITSystem data entry for some clinicians.
CONCLUSIONS: Provider experiences with the HITSystem indicate that the usefulness
of the HITSystem, along with the ease with which it is able to be incorporated
into hospital workflows, contributes to its sustained adoption and use in Kenyan 
hospitals. To maximize implementation success, care should be taken in
intervention design and implementation to ensure that end users see clear
advantages to using the technology and to account for variations in workflows,
patient populations, and resource levels by allowing flexibility to suit user
needs.

OBJECTIVES/DESIGN: As antiretroviral therapy (ART) rapidly expands in Sub-Saharan
Africa using new efficient care models, data on costs of these approaches are
lacking. We examined costs of a streamlined HIV care delivery model within a
large HIV test-and-treat study in Uganda and Kenya.
METHODS: We calculated observed per-person-per-year (ppy) costs of streamlined
care in 17 health facilities in SEARCH Study intervention communities
(NCT:01864603) via micro-costing techniques, time-and-motion studies, staff
interviews, and administrative records. Cost categories included salaries, ART,
viral load (VL) testing, recurring goods/services, and fixed capital/facility
costs. We then modeled costs under three increasingly efficient scale-up
scenarios: (1) lowest-cost ART, (2) centralized VL testing, and (3) governmental 
healthcare worker salaries. We assessed the relationship between
community-specific ART delivery costs, retention in care, and viral suppression.
RESULTS: Estimated streamlined HIV care delivery costs were $291/ppy. ART
($117/ppy for TDF/3TC/EFV [40%]) and VL testing ($110/ppy for 2 tests/year [39%])
dominated costs versus salaries ($51/ppy), recurring costs ($5/ppy), and fixed
costs ($7/ppy). Optimized ART scale-up with lowest-cost ART ($100/ppy), annual VL
testing ($24/ppy), and governmental healthcare salaries ($27/ppy), lowered
streamlined care cost to $163/ppy. We found clinic-to-clinic heterogeneity in
retention and viral suppression levels versus streamlined care delivery costs,
but no correlation between cost and either retention or viral suppression.
CONCLUSIONS: In the SEARCH Study, streamlined HIV care delivery costs were
similar to or lower than prior estimates despite including VL testing; further
optimizations could substantially reduce costs further. These data can inform
global strategies for financing ART expansion to achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets.

OBJECTIVE: The International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) was developed as a tool to
detect HIV-dementia in both industrialized and resource-limited settings. Studies
employing the IHDS have produced mixed results, with recent data suggesting
unusually high rates of dementia among Ugandans. This study aimed to define the
performance characteristics of the IHDS in three African countries.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: We recruited 2208 HIV-infected and 429 HIV-uninfected individuals from
East Africa (Kenya n = 1384; Tanzania n = 368; Uganda n = 456) who underwent
testing with the IHDS and a 30-minute neuropsychological testing battery.
Cognitive impairment was defined as -1SD on two of 6 tests or -2SD on one test
compared to demographically matched controls stratified by age and education. We 
examined predictive capacity of the IHDS to detect cognitive impairment using
receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) ages of the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected groups were
39.7 (10.7) and 37.4 (10.4), respectively. Among HIV-infected individuals, 1508
(68%) were on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), 1298 (61%) had plasma
viral load <500 copies/ml and 884 (38%) met criteria for cognitive impairment.
Using the customary IHDS cut-off of 10, 1136 (83%) of the HIV-infected
participants met criteria for dementia resulting in 91% sensitivity but only 17% 
specificity. A modified cut-off score of 8 derived from the ROC resulted in low
sensitivity (56%) and specificity (64%).
CONCLUSIONS: The IHDS has poor performance characteristics for the identification
of cognitive impairment in East Africa. Cultural-informed and sensitive screening
tests are needed to detect mild cognitive dysfunctions in developing countries.

University, Eldoret, Kenya.

OBJECTIVE: Characterize failure and resistance above and below
guidelines-recommended 1,000 copies/mL virologic threshold, upon 2-line failure.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Kenyan adults on lopinavir/ritonavir-based 2-line were enrolled at
AMPATH (Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare). Charts were reviewed for 
demographic/clinical characteristics and CD4/viral load (VL) were obtained.
Participants with detectable VL had a second visit and pol genotyping was
attempted in both visits. Accumulated resistance was defined as mutations in the 
second, not the first visit. Low level viremia (LLV) was detectable
VL < 1,000 copies/mL. Failure and resistance associations were evaluated using
logistic and Poisson regression, Fisher Exact and t-tests.
RESULTS: Of 394 participants (median age 42, 60% female, median 1.9 years on
2-line) 48% had detectable VL; 21% had VL > 1,000 copies/mL, associated with
younger age, tuberculosis treatment, shorter time on 2-line, lower
CD4 count/percent, longer 1-line treatment interruption and pregnancy. In 105
sequences from the first visit (35 with LLV), 79% had resistance (57% dual-, 7%
triple-class; 46% with intermediate-high-level resistance to ≥1 future drug
option). LLV was associated with more overall and NRTI-associated mutations and
with predicted resistance to more next-regimen drugs. In 48 second-visit
sequences (after median 55 days; IQR 28-33), 40% accumulated resistance and LLV
was associated with more mutation accumulation.
CONCLUSIONS: High resistance upon 2-line failure exists at levels above and below
guidelines-recommended virologic-failure threshold, impacting future treatment
options. Optimization of care should include increased VL monitoring, resistance 
testing and 3-line ART access, and consideration of lowering the virologic
failure threshold, though this demands further investigation.

The mealybug, Phenacoccus manihoti, is a leading pest of cassava (Manihot
esculenta Crantz), damaging this crop globally. Although the biological control
of this mealybug using natural predators has been established, resistance
breeding remains an important means of control. Understanding plant responses to 
insect herbivory, by determining and identifying differentially expressed genes
(DEGs), is a vital step towards the understanding of molecular mechanisms of
defence responses in plants and the development of resistant cultivars by gene
editing. Morphological and molecular analysis confirmed the mealybug identity as 
Phenacoccus manihoti (Matile-Ferrero). The transcriptome response of the green
mite resistant cassava genotype AR23.1 was compared to P40/1 with no known
resistance at 24 and 72 hours of mealybug infestation compared to non-infested
mock. A total of 301 and 206 genes were differentially expressed at 24 and 72 of 
mealybug infestation for AR23.1 and P40/1 genotypes respectively, using a log2
fold change and P-value ≤ 0.05. Gene ontology functional classification revealed 
an enrichment of genes in the secondary metabolic process category in AR23.1 in
comparison with P40/1, while genes in the regulation of molecular function,
cellular component biogenesis and electron carrier categories were more
significantly enriched in P40/1 than in AR23.1. Biological pathway analysis,
based on KEGG, revealed a significant enrichment of plant-pathogen interaction
and plant hormonal signal transduction pathways for a cohort of up-regulated and 
down-regulated DEGs in both genotypes. Defence-related genes such as
2-oxogluterate, gibberellin oxidase and terpene synthase proteins were only
induced in genotype AR23.1 and not in P40/1, and subsequently validated by
RT-qPCR. The study revealed a difference in response to mealybug infestation in
the two genotypes studied, with AR23.1 showing a higher number of differentially 
expressed transcripts post mealybug infestation at 24 and 72 hours. Candidate
defence-related genes that were overexpressed in the AR23.1 genotype post
mealybug infestation will be useful in future functional studies towards the
control of mealybugs.

Using multilevel models, we examined mother-, father-, and child-reported (N =
1,336 families) externalizing behavior problem trajectories from age 7 to 14 in
nine countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden,
Thailand, and the United States). The intercept and slope of children's
externalizing behavior trajectories varied both across individuals within culture
and across cultures, and the variance was larger at the individual level than at 
the culture level. Mothers' and children's endorsement of aggression as well as
mothers' authoritarian attitudes predicted higher age 8 intercepts of child
externalizing behaviors. Furthermore, prediction from individual-level
endorsement of aggression and authoritarian attitudes to more child externalizing
behaviors was augmented by prediction from cultural-level endorsement of
aggression and authoritarian attitudes, respectively. Cultures in which
father-reported endorsement of aggression was higher and both mother- and
father-reported authoritarian attitudes were higher also reported more child
externalizing behavior problems at age 8. Among fathers, greater attributions
regarding uncontrollable success in caregiving situations were associated with
steeper declines in externalizing over time. Understanding cultural-level as well
as individual-level correlates of children's externalizing behavior offers
potential insights into prevention and intervention efforts that can be more
effectively targeted at individual children and parents as well as targeted at
changing cultural norms that increase the risk of children's and adolescents'
externalizing behavior.

The value of exotic wheat genetic resources for accelerating grain yield gains is
largely unproven and unrealized. We used next-generation sequencing, together
with multi-environment phenotyping, to study the contribution of exotic genomes
to 984 three-way-cross-derived (exotic/elite1//elite2) pre-breeding lines (PBLs).
Genomic characterization of these lines with haplotype map-based and SNP marker
approaches revealed exotic specific imprints of 16.1 to 25.1%, which compares to 
theoretical expectation of 25%. A rare and favorable haplotype (GT) with 0.4%
frequency in gene bank identified on chromosome 6D minimized grain yield (GY)
loss under heat stress without GY penalty under irrigated conditions. More
specifically, the 'T' allele of the haplotype GT originated in Aegilops tauschii 
and was absent in all elite lines used in study. In silico analysis of the SNP
showed hits with a candidate gene coding for isoflavone reductase IRL-like
protein in Ae. tauschii. Rare haplotypes were also identified on chromosomes 1A, 
6A and 2B effective against abiotic/biotic stresses. Results demonstrate positive
contributions of exotic germplasm to PBLs derived from crosses of exotics with
CIMMYT's best elite lines. This is a major impact-oriented pre-breeding effort at
CIMMYT, resulting in large-scale development of PBLs for deployment in breeding
programs addressing food security under climate change scenarios.

In 1967 G.G. Simpson described three partial mandibles from early Miocene
deposits in Kenya that he interpreted as belonging to a new strepsirrhine
primate, Propotto. This interpretation was quickly challenged, with the assertion
that Propotto was not a primate, but rather a pteropodid fruit bat. The latter
interpretation has not been questioned for almost half a century. Here we
re-evaluate the affinities of Propotto, drawing upon diverse lines of evidence to
establish that this strange mammal is a strepsirrhine primate as originally
suggested by Simpson. Moreover, our phylogenetic analyses support the recognition
of Propotto, together with late Eocene Plesiopithecus from Egypt, as African stem
chiromyiform lemurs that are exclusively related to the extant aye-aye
(Daubentonia) from Madagascar. Our results challenge the long-held view that all 
lemurs are descended from a single ancient colonization of Madagascar, and
present an intriguing alternative scenario in which two lemur lineages dispersed 
from Africa to Madagascar independently, possibly during the later Cenozoic.

BACKGROUND: Health care resource allocation remains challenging in lower middle
income countries such as Kenya with meager resources being allocated to
resuscitation and critical care. The causes and outcomes for in-hospital cardiac 
arrest and resuscitation have not been studied.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the initial rhythm and the survival
for patients developing in-hospital cardiac arrest.
METHODS: This was a prospective study for in-hospital cardiac arrest in 6 Kenyan 
hospitals from July 2014 to April 2016. Resuscitation teams were utilized to
collect data during resuscitation using a standardized protocol. Patients with
do-not-resuscitate orders, trauma, postsurgical, and pregnancy-related
complications were excluded. The Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS)- systolic
blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, and responsiveness-was
determined based on worst parameters at least 4 hours prior to the arrest.
RESULTS: A total of 353 patients with cardiac arrest were included over 19
months. The mean age was 61 years, 53.5% were male, and admission diagnoses
included cardiovascular disease (15%), pneumonia 18.13%, and cancer 9%. The mean 
MEWS was 4.48 and low, intermediate, and high MEWS were found in 25.8%, 29.5%,
and 44.8%, respectively. The mean time to cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 0.84 
min. The initial rhythm was asystole in 47.6%, pulseless electrical activity in
38.2%, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in 5.4%, and unknown in
8.8%. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) occurred in 29.2% of patients with
the mean time to ROSC being 5.3 min. ROSC occurred in 17.3% of patients with
asystole, 40.7% in pulseless electrical activity, 57.9% in ventricular
tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, and 25.8% in patients with an unknown
rhythm. Of all patients, 16 (4.2%) were discharged alive.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonshockable rhythms account for the majority of the cardiac arrests
in hospitals in a lower middle income country and are associated with unfavorable
outcomes. Future work should be directed to training health care personnel in
recognizing early warning signs and implementing appropriate measures in a
resource-scarce environment.

Ecological immunity of human milk: Life history perspectives from the United
States and Kenya.

Miller EM(1).

OBJECTIVES: Previous research has established population variation in
anti-inflammatory immunological biomarkers in human milk. This immunity is
potentially ecology-dependent and may alter the life history trade-off between
growth and maintenance in infants. The current study has two aims: (1) to assess 
the ecological differences in milk immunity in two populations, one from the
urban U.S. and one from rural Kenya; and (2) to test the hypothesis that milk
immunity can affect infant growth indicators.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Kenyan Ariaal (n = 233) and U.S. (n = 75) breastfeeding
mother-infant pairs participated in a cross-sectional study at two separate field
sites. Laboratory analysis was performed on milk for the anti-inflammatory
biomarkers TGF-β2, sTNF-αRI, sTNF-αRII, and IL-1ra using ELISA. Multiple
imputation was used to extrapolate data below the limit of detection before
multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: There were significant differences between U.S. and Kenyan mothers on
all four milk biomarkers, with Kenyan mothers having significantly higher
sTNF-αRI and sTNF-αRII and lower TGF-β2 and IL-1ra than U.S. mothers. U.S.
mothers with higher milk TGF-β2 and IL-1ra have infants that are significantly
longer and heavier for their age, while Kenyan mothers with higher sTNF-αRI have 
significantly longer and heavier infants for their age, and those with higher
TGF-β2 have marginally significantly longer infants.
DISCUSSION: There were significant differences in ecological milk immunity
between U.S. and Kenyan mothers. These differences potentially play a role in the
growth of their infants. Further research in milk immunity should consider the
possibility of shared maternal-infant life histories.

Emerging evidence has shown a gradual increase in sexually transmitted infections
among elderly. This study explores the views of elderly Yoruba men and women
(60+) on condoms use and its suitability against sexual infections. The research 
design was a sequential exploratory mixed method that consisted of vignettes
based focus group discussion and a structured questionnaire. Twelve vignettes
based Focus Group Discussion and a survey of 252 elderly Yoruba people (aged 60+)
were carried out. The findings revealed limited awareness and experience with
condoms. Few of the male (20.4%) and 2.8% of the female respondents felt condom
use can prevent sexually transmitted infections. A marginally proportion of the
females (29.2%) than the males (25.0%) perceived condom as more useful for
younger people. Condom use as a preventive measure against sexual infections
varies by gender and marital status (p = .000). Gender and marital status also
had an influence on whether condom use could reduce sexual pleasures (p = 0.000).
These findings offer strong support of the sexual pleasure hypothesis which is
often invoked to explain attitude toward condom use in a variety of social and
cultural contexts. Social marketing of condoms is urgently required to address
misconceptions around condom use and encourage uptake among sexually active
elderly people.

Background: Textile wastewater contains a significant amount of bio dye compounds
including Reactive Black 5 (RB5) as an Azo dye that causes serious damage to the 
environment and aquatic life in receiving water resources. It is estimated that
approximately 15% of the dyestuff is discharged into water bodies and 50% of
those are Azo dyes.
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of combining
electrocoagulation and bio-adsorption methods using the active carbons from Kenya
tea waste to remove RB5 from aquatic solutions.
Methods: Experiments were done in wastewater and the Wastewater laboratory of
Gonabad University of Medical Sciences in 2017. Initially, iron electrodes were
installed in a 1 L glass container and connected to electrical power with primary
dye concentration of 500 mg/l, EC 1000-3000 μs/cm, adsorbent dosage of 0.2-1.0
mg/l, pH 2-9 and electrical potential 30 V. After that, the samples were
collected at twenty-minute intervals until the eightieth minute. Performance of
dye removal was measured using spectrophotometer techniques (597 nm). Finally,
the data were analyzed by descriptive statistics using Microsoft Excel 2017
version.
Results: The findings of this study demonstrated that the highest simultaneous
removal performance (96%) was obtained by pH 6, 80-minute reaction time, and EC
3000 μs/cm. With the increasing of reaction time, the energy consumption,
electrodes wear, pH, final temperature of effluent, and removal efficiency would 
increase. Adsorption process could play a small role in the removal of the dye,
while it was very effective in improving the performance of the
electrocoagulation process.
Conclusion: A combination of the electrocoagulation and adsorption processes can 
be adopted as an efficient and economical way to treat effluents contaminated
with dyestuff.

Monumental architecture is a prime indicator of social complexity, because it
requires many people to build a conspicuous structure commemorating shared
beliefs. Examining monumentality in different environmental and economic settings
can reveal diverse reasons for people to form larger social units and express
unity through architectural display. In multiple areas of Africa, monumentality
developed as mobile herders created large cemeteries and practiced other forms of
commemoration. The motives for such behavior in sparsely populated, unpredictable
landscapes may differ from well-studied cases of monumentality in predictable
environments with sedentary populations. Here we report excavations and
ground-penetrating radar surveys at the earliest and most massive monumental site
in eastern Africa. Lothagam North Pillar Site was a communal cemetery near Lake
Turkana (northwest Kenya) constructed 5,000 years ago by eastern Africa's
earliest pastoralists. Inside a platform ringed by boulders, a 119.5-m2 mortuary 
cavity accommodated an estimated minimum of 580 individuals. People of diverse
ages and both sexes were buried, and ornaments accompanied most individuals.
There is no evidence for social stratification. The uncertainties of living on a 
"moving frontier" of early herding-exacerbated by dramatic environmental
shifts-may have spurred people to strengthen social networks that could provide
information and assistance. Lothagam North Pillar Site would have served as both 
an arena for interaction and a tangible reminder of shared identity.

High-dose ivermectin, co-administered for 3-days with
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), killed mosquitoes feeding on individuals for
at least 28-days post-treatment in a recent trial (IVERMAL), while 7-days was
predicted pre-trial. The current study assessed the relationship between
ivermectin blood concentrations and the observed mosquitocidal effects against
Anopheles gambiae. 3-days ivermectin 0, 300, or 600 mcg/kg/day plus DP was
randomly assigned to 141 adults with uncomplicated malaria in Kenya. During
28-days follow-up, 1,393 venous and 335 paired capillary plasma samples, 850
mosquito-cluster mortality rates, and 524 QTcF-intervals were collected. Using
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling, we show a consistent
correlation between predicted ivermectin concentrations and observed
mosquitocidal-effects throughout the 28-day study duration, without invoking an
unidentified mosquitocidal metabolite or drug-drug-interaction. Ivermectin had no
effect on piperaquine's pharmacokinetics or QTcF-prolongation. The PK-PD model
can be used to design new treatment regimens with predicted mosquitocidal effect.
This methodology could be used to evaluate effectiveness of other endectocides.

BACKGROUND: The African citrus triozid (ACT) Trioza erytreae Del Guercio
(Hemiptera: Triozidae), is one of the most devastating pest of citrus with a
well-known role as a vector of the phloem-limited bacteria [Candidatus
Liberibacter africanus] associated with huanglongbing (HLB; citrus greening
disease), currently considered the world's most serious disease of citrus.
Although the pest can successfully develop and reproduce on non-citrus host
plants, there is no documented information on geometric morphometry of ACT. We
determine the effect of host plants on ACT morphometry under controlled
laboratory conditions using traditional and geometric analysis.
RESULTS: ACT reared on C. limon and Citroncirus spp. were significantly larger
than those reared on the other host plant species. ACT reared on C. anisata and
C. tangelo were consistently smaller than those from M. koenigii and C. sinensis.
Based on warped outline drawings, ACT reared on Citroncirus spp. and Murraya
koenigii had narrower wings than those reared on C. anisata, C. limon and C.
sinensis with slightly broader wing patterns.
CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrates that host plant species affect
morphometric variation in ACT, which might have a direct impact on fitness
parameters of the pest as well as its potential for dispersion. Wing shape and
size appears to be useful in separating populations of ACT into different groups.

UV resistance of bacteria isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Moorea
producens has not been observed previously, findings which highlight how
unsafe germicidal UV irradiation for sterilization of air, food, and water could 
be. Further, UV resistance of Bacillus licheniformis is being observed for the
first time. This study focused on bacteria isolated from the marine
cyanobacterium M. producens collected off the Kenyan coast at Shimoni, Wasini,
Kilifi, and Mida. UV irradiance of isolates (302 nm, 70 W/m2 , 0-1 hr)
established B. licheniformis as the most UV resistant strain, with the following 
order of taxon resistance: Bacilli> γ proteobacteria > Actinobacteria. UV
resistance was independent of pigmentation. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic
distance determined for both B. licheniformis and Bacillus aerius relative to
M. producens CCAP 1446/4 was 2.0. Survival of B. licheniformis upon UV irradiance
followed first-order kinetics (k = 0.035/min, R2  = 0.88). Addition of aqueous
extracts (2, 10, 20 and 40 mg/ml) of this B. licheniformis strain on the less
resistant Marinobacterium stanieri was not significant, however, the commercial
sunscreen benzophenone-3 (BP-3) positive control and the time of irradiance were 
significant. Detection of bacteria on M. producens filaments stained with
acridine orange confirmed its nonaxenic nature. Although the chemistry of UV
resistance in cyanobacteria has been studied in depth revealing for example the
role of mycosporine like amino acids (MAAs) in UV resistance less is known about 
how bacteria resist UV irradiation. This is of interest since cyanobacteria live 
in association with bacteria.

Background: Invasive species are a growing threat to food biosecurity and cause
significant economic losses in agricultural systems. Despite their damaging
effect, they are attractive models for the study of evolution and adaptation in
newly colonised environments. The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, as
a member of the family Tephritidae, is one of the most studied invasive species
feeding on many fruit crops in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. This study
aims to determine the global macrogeographic population structure of Ceratitis
capitata and reconstruct its potential migration routes.
Method: A partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene from >400 individual
medflies and 14 populations from four continents was sequenced and subjected to
Bayesian demographic modelling.
Results: The Afrotropical populations (Kenya, South Africa and Ghana) harbour the
majority of haplotypes detected, which also are highly divergent, in accordance
with the presumed ancestral range of medflies in Sub-Saharan Africa. All other
populations in the presumed non-native areas were dominated by a single haplotype
also present in South Africa, in addition to a few, closely related haplotypes
unique to a single local population or regional set, but missing from Africa.
Bayesian coalescence methods revealed recent migration pathways from Africa to
all continents, in addition to limited bidirectional migration among many local
and intercontinental routes.
Conclusion: The detailed investigation of the recent migration history highlights
the interconnectedness of affected crop production regions worldwide and
pinpoints the routes and potential source areas requiring more specific
quarantine measures.

The global commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 places HIV prevention
at the centre of the response. With the disease continuing to disproportionately 
affect young populations in the Eastern and Southern African Region (ESAR),
particularly adolescent girls and young women, reducing HIV infections in this
group is integral to achieving this ambitious target. This paper examines
epidemiological patterns of the HIV epidemic among adolescents and young people, 
indicating where HIV prevention efforts need to be focused (i.e., adolescent
girls and young women, adolescent boys and young men and young key populations). 
Key innovations in the science of HIV prevention and strategies for dealing with 
programme implementation are reviewed. The paper also discusses the value of
processes to mitigate HIV vulnerability and recommends actions needed to sustain 
the HIV prevention response. Stemming the tide of new HIV infections among young 
people in the ESAR requires an amplification of efforts across all sectors, which
will safeguard past achievements and advance actions towards eliminating AIDS as 
a public health threat.

Purpose: In resource-limited HIV care settings, effective and innovative
interventions that respond to the existing challenges along the HIV care
continuum are urgently needed to realize the benefits of antiretroviral therapy
(ART). Initiating effective ART adherence dialog in an environment that promotes 
patient engagement in care is key. It is therefore critical to enhance our
understanding about how patients living with HIV in these regions conceptualize
and experience patient engagement. This study explores HIV patients' perceptions,
experiences and expectations of their engagement in care.
Materials and methods: We sampled 86 patients from three Academic Model for
Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATHplus) sites, one urban and two rural. We
conducted 24 in-depth interviews and eight focus group discussions in either
Swahili or English. Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed, and then
translated into English. We performed content analysis after thematic coding.
Results: Patients living with HIV in Kenya desire active engagement with care.
However, their engagement was inconsistent and varied depending on the provider. 
Patients had a sense of how provider's interpersonal behaviors influenced their
level of engagement. These included various aspects of provider-patient
communication and relationship dynamics. Patients also highlighted relational
boundaries that influenced the level and kind of information they shared with
their providers. Aspects of their psychological, social or economic wellbeing
were often viewed as personal and not discussed with their clinicians. Patients
identified factors that would promote or impede their engagement with care
including those related to patients themselves, providers, and the healthcare
system.
Conclusion: Patients living with HIV desired more active engagement in their
care. In addition, they desired clinicians to engage in more social behaviors to 
promote patient engagement. To address existing patient engagement barriers, HIV 
care systems in the region should apply contextualized patient-centered
interventions.

In rainfed crop production, root zone plant-available water holding capacity
(RZ-PAWHC) of the soil has a large influence on crop growth and the yield
response to management inputs such as improved seeds and fertilisers. However,
data are lacking for this parameter in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study
produced the first spatially explicit, coherent and complete maps of the rootable
depth and RZ-PAWHC of soil in SSA. We compiled geo-referenced data from 28,000
soil profiles from SSA, which were used as input for digital soil mapping (DSM)
techniques to produce soil property maps of SSA. Based on these soil properties, 
we developed and parameterised (pedotransfer) functions, rules and criteria to
evaluate soil water retention at field capacity and wilting point, the soil fine 
earth fraction from coarse fragments content and, for maize, the soil rootability
(relative to threshold values) and rootable depth. Maps of these secondary soil
properties were derived using the primary soil property maps as input for the
evaluation rules and the results were aggregated over the rootable depth to
obtain a map of RZ-PAWHC, with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. The mean RZ-PAWHC
for SSA is 74 mm and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm. Pearson
correlation between the two is 0.95. RZ-PAWHC proves most limited by the rootable
depth but is also highly sensitive to the definition of field capacity. The total
soil volume of SSA potentially rootable by maize is reduced by one third (over
10,500 km3) due to soil conditions restricting root zone depth. Of these,
4800 km3 are due to limited depth of aeration, which is the factor most severely 
limiting in terms of extent (km2), and 2500 km3 due to sodicity which is most
severely limiting in terms of degree (depth in cm). Depth of soil to bedrock
reduces the rootable soil volume by 2500 km3, aluminium toxicity by 600 km3,
porosity by 120 km3 and alkalinity by 20 km3. The accuracy of the map of rootable
depth and thus of RZ-PAWHC could not be validated quantitatively due to absent
data on rootability and rootable depth but is limited by the accuracy of the
primary soil property maps. The methodological framework is robust and has been
operationalised such that the maps can easily be updated as additional data
become available.

We hypothesised that use of reproductive technologies (RTs) would result in
increases in economic and genetic gains of a dairy cattle breeding programme. A
deterministic approach was used to compare RTs that can be utilised to increase
dairy cattle productivity and profitability in Kenya. These were artificial
insemination (AI), embryo transfer (ET) using old (ETOB) and young (ETYB) bulls
and in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Natural mating (NAm) was assumed to be the
standard reproduction practice in Kenya against which the genetic and economic
efficiencies of the RTs were compared. A three tiers open nucleus system was
assumed to describe the dairy cattle breeding programme in Kenya. It was open to 
use of imported semen in the nucleus. The nucleus was assumed to be closed to
upward movement of live animals. This is the common practice in Kenya where large
farms act as the nucleus from which the multipliers (medium-sized farms) buy
replacement stock and subsequently sell replacement animals to the commercial
sector (smallholder farms). The increase in monetary gain ranged between 11% when
AI was used and 184% when utilising either juvenile ET or IVF. The ETYB and IVF
resulted in similar economic and genetic responses for all comparison criteria.
The generation interval reduced by between 0.8% in AI and 47% in ETYB and IVF
technologies. The respective milk yield (MY) and daily weight gain (dWG)
responses were between 25 to 150% and 0 to 110% for the AI and ETYB and IVF.

Poultry are important for many poor households in developing countries, but there
are many constraints to poultry production, including disease. One of the most
important diseases of chickens is Newcastle disease (ND). Even though there are
effective vaccines against this disease available in most countries, uptake by
small-scale poultry keepers is often low. In this study, two areas in Kenya and
Tanzania were studied, where some villages had received additional support to get
vaccination and other villages had not. In Kenya, 320 households from 10 villages
were interviewed, of which half of the villages had active promotion of
vaccination through village-based advisors. In Tanzania, 457 households were
interviewed, of which 241 came from villages that have had active support through
either a project or government extension services. Knowledge about vaccines and
the attitudes towards vaccinating against ND was evaluated using mixed
multivariable logistic models. Results indicate that in Kenya, the most important
determinants for understanding the function of a vaccine were having had support 
in the village and to have knowledge about ND signs, while in Tanzania gender and
previous vaccine use were important in addition to having had support. Attitudes 
towards vaccination were mainly determined by knowledge, where more knowledge
about how vaccines work in general or about ND contributed to more positive
attitudes. Among Kenyan farmers that had never used the vaccine before, the
amount of birds they lost to disease and predators also influenced attitudes. In 
conclusion, this study supports the notion that knowledge is a very important
component of extension support and that simply making vaccines available may not 
be sufficient for high levels of uptake.

Drought-induced tree mortality has been recently increasing and is expected to
increase further under warming climate. Conversely, tree species that survive
under arid conditions might provide vital information on successful drought
resistance strategies. Although Acacia (Vachellia) species dominate many of the
globe's deserts, little is known about their growth dynamics and water-use in
situ. Stem diameter dynamics, leaf phenology, and sap flow were monitored during 
3 consecutive years in five Acacia raddiana trees and five Acacia tortilis trees 
in the Arid Arava Valley, southern Israel (annual precipitation 20-70 mm,
restricted to October-May). We hypothesized that stem growth and other tree
activities are synchronized with, and limited to single rainfall or flashflood
events. Unexpectedly, cambial growth of both Acacia species was arrested during
the wet season, and occurred during most of the dry season, coinciding with
maximum daily temperatures as high as 45 °C and vapor pressure deficit of up to
9 kPa. Summer growth was correlated with peak sap flow in June, with almost
year-round activity and foliage cover. To the best of our knowledge, these are
the harshest drought conditions ever documented permitting cambial growth. These 
findings point to the possibility that summer cambial growth in Acacia under
hyper-arid conditions relies on concurrent leaf gas exchange, which is in turn
permitted by access to deep soil water. Soil water can support low-density tree
populations despite heat and drought, as long as recharge is kept above a minimum
threshold.

BACKGROUND: Tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy is a safe, highly effective, and
permanent way to limit childbearing. We aimed to establish whether the safety of 
the procedure provided by trained clinical officers (COs) was not inferior to the
safety when provided by trained assistant medical officers (AMOs), as measured by
major adverse event (AE) rates.
METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, open-label noninferiority trial, we
enrolled participants at 7 health facilities in Arusha region, Tanzania, as well 
as during outreach activities conducted in Arusha and neighboring regions.
Consenting, eligible participants were randomly allocated by a research assistant
at each site to minilaparotomy performed by a trained CO or by a trained AMO, in 
a 1:1 ratio. We asked participants to return at 3, 7, and 42 days postsurgery.
The primary outcome was the rate of major AEs following minilaparotomy performed 
by COs versus AMOs, during the procedure and through 42 days follow-up. The
noninferiority margin was 2%. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
Identifier NCT02944149.
RESULTS: We randomly allocated 1,970 participants between December 2016 and June 
2017, 984 to the CO group and 986 to the AMO group. Most (87%) minilaparotomies
were conducted during outreach services. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 0 of
978 participants had a major AE in the CO group compared with 1 (0.1%) of 984 in 
the AMO group (incidence rate difference: 0.001% [95% confidence interval:
-0.003% to 0.001%]), meeting the criteria for noninferiority. We saw no evidence 
of differences in measures of procedure performance, participant satisfaction, or
provider self-efficacy between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy performed by trained COs is safe, 
effective, and acceptable to women, and the procedure can be safely and
effectively provided in outreach settings. Our results provide evidence to
support policy change in resource-limited settings to allow task shifting of
minilaparotomy to properly trained and supported COs, increasing access to female
sterilization and helping to meet the rising demand for the procedure among women
wanting to avoid pregnancy. They also suggest high demand for these services in
Tanzania, given the large number of women recruited in a relatively short time
period.

BACKGROUND: House improvement and environmental management can significantly
improve malaria transmission control in endemic communities. This study assessed 
the influence of physical characteristics of houses and surrounding environments 
on mosquito biting risk in rural Tanzanian villages, and examined knowledge and
perceptions of residents on relationships between these factors and malaria
transmission. The study further assessed whether people worried about these risks
and how they coped.
METHODS: Entomological surveys of indoor mosquito densities were conducted across
four villages in Ulanga district, south-eastern Tanzania. The survey involved 48 
sentinel houses sampled monthly and other sets of 48 houses randomly recruited
each month for one-off sampling over 12 months. Physical characteristics of the
houses and surrounding environments were recorded. Questionnaire surveys were
administered to 200 household heads to assess their knowledge and concerns
regarding the observed housing and environmental features, and whether they
considered these features when constructing houses. Focus group discussions, were
conducted to clarify emergent themes on people's perceptions on relationships
between housing or environmental factors and malaria transmission.
RESULTS: The entomological surveys showed statistically higher indoor densities
of the malaria vectors (Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus) in houses
with mud walls compared to plastered or brick walls, open eaves compared to
closed eaves and unscreened windows compared to screened windows. Most
respondents reported that their houses allowed mosquito entry, at least
partially. Participants were aware that house structure and environmental
characteristics influenced indoor mosquito densities and consequently malaria
transmission. They were concerned about living in poorly-constructed houses with 
gaps on eaves, walls, windows and doors but were constrained by low income.
CONCLUSION: In rural south-eastern Tanzania, significant proportions of people
still live in houses with open eaves, unscreened windows and gaps on doors.
Though they are fully aware of associated mosquito biting and pathogen
transmission risks, they are constrained by low-income levels. The study proposes
that community-based house improvement initiatives combined with targeted
subsidies could lower the financial barriers, improve access to essential
construction materials or designs, and significantly accelerate malaria
transmission control in these communities.

BACKGROUND: A menstrual cup can be a good solution for menstrual hygiene
management in economically challenged settings. As part of a pilot study we
assessed uptake and maintenance of cup use among young school girls in Kenya.
METHODS: A total of 192 girls between 14 to 16 years were enrolled in 10 schools 
in Nyanza Province, Western Kenya; these schools were assigned menstrual cups as 
part of the cluster-randomized pilot study. Girls were provided with menstrual
cups in addition to training and guidance on use, puberty education, and
instructions for menstrual hygiene. During repeated individual visits with
nurses, girls reported use of the menstrual cup and nurses recorded colour change
of the cup.
RESULTS: Girls were able to keep their cups in good condition, with only 12 cups 
(6.3%) lost (dropped in toilet, lost or destroyed). Verbally reported cup use
increased from 84% in the first 3 months (n = 143) to 96% after 9 months
(n = 74). Colour change of the cup, as 'uptake' indicator of use, was detected in
70.8% of 192 participants, with a median time of 5 months (range 1-14 months).
Uptake differed by school and was significantly higher among girls who
experienced menarche within the past year (adjusted risk ratio 1.29, 95% CI
1.04-1.60), and was faster among girls enrolled in the second study year (hazard 
ratio 3.93, 95% CI 2.09-7.38). The kappa score comparing self-report and cup
colour observation was 0.044 (p = 0.028), indicating that agreement was only
slightly higher than by random chance.
CONCLUSIONS: Objective evidence through cup colour change suggests school girls
in rural Africa can use menstrual cups, with uptake improving with peer group
education and over time.

SUMMARY: Pollution is a major, overlooked, global health threat that was
responsible in 2015 for an estimated 9 million deaths and great economic losses. 
To end neglect of pollution and advance prevention of pollution-related disease, 
we formed the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health. Despite recent gains in 
understanding of pollution and its health effects, this Commission noted that
large gaps in knowledge remain. To close these gaps and guide prevention, the
Commission made research recommendations and proposed creation of a Global
Observatory on Pollution and Health. We posit that successful pollution research 
will be translational and based on transdisciplinary collaborations among
exposure science, epidemiology, data science, engineering, health policy, and
economics. We envision that the Global Observatory on Pollution and Health will
be a multinational consortium based at Boston College and the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health that will aggregate, geocode, and archive data on
pollution and pollution-related disease; analyze these data to discern trends,
geographic patterns, and opportunities for intervention; and make its findings
available to policymakers, the media, and the global public to catalyze research,
inform policy, and assist cities and countries to target pollution, track
progress, and save lives. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3141.

Background: The health needs in poor communities are often dictated by data that 
is not relevant to the community. The capabilities approach (CA) offers a
philosophical and practical way to frame and analyse data and apply it to a
community using the World Health Organisation socioeconomic framework. This was
part of the NHS Health Education England East Midlands Global Health Exchange
Fellow Programme.
Methods: A team of 2 Kenyan and 2 UK community clinicians worked together in
deprived communities in Kenya and the UK using qualitative research methods to
facilitate the communities to define and prioritise their health needs and to
explore their potential resources and how they might achieve their needs
sustainably. The CA was used in the data collection and data analysis phases.
Results: The team of fellows gained personal understanding of the reality of the 
impact of social determinants on health experiences and outcomes. The CA offers
the health systems and services a way to engage hard to reach communities with
issues that they know to be important and are then able to prioritise. Clinicians
who are taught in the evidence based style need to reframe their understanding of
community needs if they are to be effective in their work. Working in this way
can challenge their own values and beliefs. With planned support this can be a
powerful developmental process and the CA is a set of principles that can be used
to facilitate the empowerment of communities, the service planners and providers.

This article investigates how international donor policies cultivate a form of
biological sub-citizenship for those with diabetes in Kenya. We interviewed 100
patients at a public hospital clinic in Nairobi, half with a diabetes diagnosis. 
We focus on three vignettes that illustrate how our study participants
differentially perceived and experienced living with and seeking treatment and
care for diabetes compared to other conditions, with a special focus on HIV. We
argue that biological sub-citizenship, where those with HIV have consistent and
comprehensive free medical care and those with diabetes must pay out-of-pocket
for testing and treatment, impedes diabetes testing and treatment. Once
diagnosed, many are then systematically excluded from the health care system due 
to their own inability to pay. We argue that the systematic exclusion from
international donor money creates a form of biological sub-citizenship based on
neoliberal economic policies that undermine other public health protections, such
as universal primary health care. This article is protected by copyright. All

etiology is poorly understood. We investigated the contribution of alcohol
consumption to esophageal cancer in Kenya, based on a hospital-based case-control
study conducted from 08/2013 to 03/2018 in Eldoret, Western Kenya. Cases had an
endoscopy-confirmed esophageal tumor whose histology did not rule out squamous
cell carcinoma. Age and gender frequency-matched controls were recruited from
hospital visitors/patients without digestive diseases. Logistic regression was
used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI)
adjusting for tobacco (type, intensity) and 6 other potential confounders. A
total of 422 cases (65% male, mean at diagnosis 60 (SD 14) years) and 414
controls were included. ORs for ever-drinking were stronger in ever-tobacco users
(9.0, 95% CI: 3.4, 23.8, with few tobacco users who were never drinkers) than in 
never-tobacco users (2.6, 95% CI: 1.6, 4.1). Risk increased linearly with number 
of drinks: OR for >6 compared to >0 to ≤2 drinks/day were 5.2 (2.4, 11.4) in
ever-tobacco users and 2.1 (0.7, 4.4) in never-tobacco users. Although most
ethanol came from low ethanol alcohols (busaa or beer), for the same ethanol
intake, if a greater proportion came from the moonshine chang'aa, it was
associated with a specific additional risk. The population attributable fraction 
for >2 drinks per day was 48% overall and highest in male tobacco users. Alcohol 
consumption, particularly of busaa and chang'aa, contributes to half of the
esophageal cancer burden in Western Kenya. This article is protected by

Cellular Stresses and Stress Responses in the Pathogenesis of Insulin Resistance.

Agriculture and Technology, P.O. Box 62000, Nairobi 00200, Kenya.

Insulin resistance (IR), a key component of the metabolic syndrome, precedes the 
development of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Its
etiological pathways are not well defined, although many contributory mechanisms 
have been established. This article summarizes such mechanisms into the
hypothesis that factors like nutrient overload, physical inactivity, hypoxia,
psychological stress, and environmental pollutants induce a network of cellular
stresses, stress responses, and stress response dysregulations that jointly
inhibit insulin signaling in insulin target cells including endothelial cells,
hepatocytes, myocytes, hypothalamic neurons, and adipocytes. The insulin
resistance-inducing cellular stresses include oxidative, nitrosative,
carbonyl/electrophilic, genotoxic, and endoplasmic reticulum stresses; the stress
responses include the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the DNA damage response, the 
unfolded protein response, apoptosis, inflammasome activation, and pyroptosis,
while the dysregulated responses include the heat shock response, autophagy, and 
nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 signaling. Insulin target cells also 
produce metabolites that exacerbate cellular stress generation both locally and
systemically, partly through recruitment and activation of myeloid cells which
sustain a state of chronic inflammation. Thus, insulin resistance may be
prevented or attenuated by multiple approaches targeting the different cellular
stresses and stress responses.

The NUITM-KEMRI biosafety training program was developed for capacity building of
new biosafety level three (BSL-3) laboratory users. The training program
comprehensively covers biosafety and biosecurity theory and practice. Its
training curriculum is based on the WHO biosafety guidelines, local biosafety
standards, and ongoing biosafety level three research activities in the facility,
also taking into consideration the emerging public health issues. The program's
training approach enhances the participant's biosafety and biosecurity knowledge 
and builds their skills through the hands-on practice sessions and mentorship
training. Subsequently, the trainees are able to integrate acquired knowledge and
good practices into their routine laboratory procedures. This article describes
implementation of the NUITM-KEMRI biosafety training program.

BACKGROUND: Nutritional iron deficiency is one of the leading factors for
disease, disability and death. A quasi-experimental randomized community study in
South-West Nigeria explored whether a branded behaviour change programme
increased the use of green leafy vegetables (greens) and iron-fortified bouillon 
cubes in stews for improved iron intake.
METHODS: A coinflip assigned the intervention to Ile-Ife (Intervention town).
Osogbo (Control town) received no information. At baseline 602 mother-daughter
pairs (daughters aged 12-18) were enrolled (Intervention: 300; Control: 302). A
Food Frequency Questionnaire assessed the addition of cubes and greens to stews, 
the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were the addition of cubes and greens to 
soups and changes in behavioural determinants measured using the Theory of
Planned Behaviour. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) evaluated the impact of
the intervention on behavioural determinants and behaviour.
RESULTS: The data of 527 pairs was used (Intervention: 240; Control: 287). The
increase in greens added to stews was larger in the Intervention town compared to
the Control town (MIntervention = 0.3 [SE = 0.03]; MControl = 0.0 [SE = 0.04],
p < 0.001, r = 0.36). Change in iron-fortified cubes added to stews did not
differ between towns (p = 0.07). The increase in cubes added to soups was larger 
in the Intervention town compared to the Control Town (MIntervention = 0.9
[SE = 0.2] vs MControl = 0.4 [SE = 0.1], p < .0001, r = 0.20). Unexpectedly,
change in greens added to soups was larger in the Control town compared to the
Intervention town (MIntervention = - 0.1 [SE = 0.1]; MControl = 0.5 [SE = 0.1],
p = 0.003, r = 0.15). The intervention positively influenced awareness of anaemia
and the determinants of behaviour in the Intervention town, with hardly any
change in the Control town. Baseline SEMs could not be established, so no
mediation analyses were done. Post-intervention SEMs highlighted the role of
habit in cooking stews.
CONCLUSIONS: The behaviour change programme increased the amount of green leafy
vegetables added to stews and iron-fortified cubes added to soups. Future
research should assess the long-term impact and the efficacy of the programme as 
it is scaled up and rolled out.

BACKGROUND: There is currently a rapid physical activity transition taking place 
in developing countries that includes a decrease in active transportation.
Building on findings from an earlier systematic review, this paper describes the 
development and convergent validity of self-administered child and parent
questionnaires assessing active transportation of children in three African
countries: Kenya, Mozambique and Nigeria.
METHODS: A pilot study was conducted to examine the convergent validity of the
developed questionnaires by comparing responses between children and their
parents (N = 121; n = 43 for Mozambique, n = 24 for Kenya and n = 54 for
Nigeria). After modification, the questionnaires were then administered to a
larger convenient sample of both children and parents from Kenya (n = 1123),
Mozambique (n = 1097) and Nigeria (n = 831) which defined the main study. The
questionnaires assessed active transportation to/from 8 categories of
destinations including school, friends' and relatives' home/houses, parks and
playgrounds among others. Twenty items were used to assess child - and
parent-perceived barriers to active transportation, and the parent questionnaire 
inquired about parent education and availability of cars, motorcycles, and
bicycles. Spearman's rho was used to compare children's mode of travel in the
pilot study while the prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) coefficient
was used to compare convergent validity between children's and parents responses 
on active transportation in the main study.
RESULTS: Findings of the main study show that convergent validity for active
transportation to and from each destination in the combined sample ranged from
0.472 (from school) to 0.998 (to other places). Convergent validity for
challenges/barriers to active transportation to school ranged from fair (0.30 -
The route does not have good lighting) to substantial (0.77 - My child has a
disability). It varied between countries from fair (n = 11-items) to moderate
(n = 9-items) agreement in Kenya and from poor (n = 2-items) to fair
(n = 16-items) agreement in Nigeria. Data from Mozambique was however missing and
therefore could be included.
CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaires provided valid information on the number of trips
to/from various destinations and show acceptable and modest convergent validity
for measuring barriers to active transport in a sample of children from three
African countries. These questionnaires may be suitable for future research on
active transport among school children in Sub-Saharan African countries.

BACKGROUND: Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) experience high rates of HIV 
early in their sexual life-course. We estimated the prevalence of HIV-associated 
vulnerabilities at first sex, and their association with lifetime gender-based
violence (GBV) and HIV.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional bio-behavioural survey among AGYW (14-24 
years) in Mombasa, Kenya in 2015. We compared the prevalence of first sex
vulnerabilities across AGYW who self-identified as engaging in sex work (N=408), 
transactional sex (N=177) or casual sex (N=714); and used logistic regression to 
identify age-adjusted associations between first sex vulnerabilities and outcomes
(GBV after first sex; HIV).
RESULTS: The median age at first sex was 16 years (IQR 14 - 18). 43.6% received
gifts or money at first sex; 41.2% and 11.2% experienced a coerced and forced
first sex respectively. First sex vulnerabilities were generally more common
among AGYW in sex work. GBV (prevalence 23.8%) and HIV (prevalence 5.6%) were
associated with first sex before age 15 (GBV AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9; HIV AOR
1.9, 95% CI 1.1-1.3); before or within 1 year of menarche (GBV AOR 1.3, 95% CI
1.0-1.7; HIV AOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.6); and receipt of money (GBV AOR 1.9, 95% CI 
1.4-2.5; HIV AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.4).
CONCLUSION: HIV-associated vulnerabilities begin at first sex and potentially
mediate an AGYW's trajectory of risk. HIV prevention programmes should include
structural interventions that reach AGYW early, and screening for a history of
first sex vulnerabilities could help identify AGYW at risk of ongoing GBV and
HIV.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative

Accurate energy metering and billing is a challenge in some developing countries.
In Nigeria, the issues of inadequate power generation, transmission and
distribution infrastructure are recurrent problems, coupled with inefficient
energy metering which is a major problem that results in residential energy
consumers being billed unfair energy charges by the Electricity Distribution
Companies (DISCOs) for unused energy, and this has been termed "crazy bill". For 
the energy sector to be effective, energy bills should be based on the actual
energy usage and likewise customers must pay for used energy. To achieve this,
the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) recommended the
installation of prepaid meters for all customers, but as at today, there is no
full compliance with this regulation. Power supply is grossly unreliable, and
this has affected power quality due to frequent load shedding and power outages. 
The dataset presented in this article captures the type of apartment, the type of
electrical appliances used by occupant, the average monthly energy bill paid for 
electricity, the use or non-use of alternative energy sources, the type of
alternative energy sources used, and the type of energy meter used by sampled
residents of the Ota community in Ogun State, Nigeria. The dataset was acquired
using an investigative questionnaire to survey the residential consumers within
the sampled space.

Water security and safety is of vital concern in arid and semiarid regions of
Kenya. Potable water accessibility and supply is limited due to fluctuating
climatic conditions and environmental pollution that lower the wholesomeness of
most water sources. The aim of this study was to establish the suitability of
these water sources for drinking and use in industrial food processing by the
small and medium enterprises (SME's). The aim of this study was to establish
suitability of these water sources for drinking and use in industrial food
processing by the small and medium enterprises (SME's). A total of 60 surface and
ground water sources samples were purposively collected aseptically from the four
administrative units (Ngare Mara, LMD, Leparua, and Wabera) of Isiolo County. ISO
16649-3, 688-2, 7937, 9308-1, and 18744 were used for enumeration of E.coli,
Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium pafringens, Coliforms, and cysts. Highest mean
Clostridium pafringens counts in ground and surface water were 1452 Cfu/ml and
3421 Cfu/ml, respectively. Mean Staphylococcus aureus counts were 740 Cfu/ml and 
1333 Cfu/ml in surface water and ground water, respectively. Escherichia coli and
Coliforms contamination accounted for 29.88 % and 88.2 %, respectively. Microbial
counts in the water sources differed significantly (p≤0.05). Total coliforms had 
a significant negative relationship (r = -0.76) with residual chlorine. Ground
and surface water sources were highly contaminated with microorganism to levels
regarded as unsafe by the Kenyan and WHO standards for potable water.
Point-of-use water disinfection is thus necessary.

Nurses play key roles in recognizing, diagnosing, managing, and referring persons
with mental disorders. This cross-sectional study assessed mental health literacy
(depression and suicidal ideation) among nurses in a private urban referral
hospital in Kenya. Nurses read a vignette and answered questions regarding
diagnosis, treatment/interventions, and related attitudes and beliefs.
Thirty-seven nurses (12 males) completed the questionnaire. Three correctly
identified the diagnosis and 23 identified depression only. Although 75% noted
the symptoms were extremely distressing, fear, and stigma were common reactions. 
This highlights challenges in mental health promotion/prevention in Kenya, and
suggests continuous nursing education and curriculum enhancement is needed.

Milk is an important source of energy and nutrients, especially for children, and
in Kenya, milk consumption is higher than other countries in the region. One
major concern with milk is the risks of chemical contaminants, and reports of
high levels of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk in Kenya has been causing public
health concerns. This study collected marketed milk products every month during
1 year, just as a consumer would purchase them from retailers and traders in a
low-income area, and a major supermarket in a middle/high-income area. In total, 
291 sampled milk products (raw, pasteurised, UHT milk, yoghurt and lala) were
collected and analysed for AFM1 using a commercial ELISA kit. More than 50% of
the samples exceeded 50 ng/kg (the level allowed in the EU), but only three
samples exceeded 500 ng/kg (the level allowed in the USA). Geometric mean AFM1
level was 61.9 ng/kg in the 135 samples from the low-income area while it was
36.1 ng/kg in the 156 from the higher income area (p < 0.001). The levels varied 
significantly depending on the time of year, with lowest levels of milk in
January. There were also differences between manufacturers and products, with UHT
milk having lower levels. There was no difference depending on the price for all 
dairy products, but when only including milk, higher price was associated with
lower levels of AFM1. In conclusion, this study shows that milk purchased by a
consumer is likely to contain AFM1 above 50 ng/kg, and that further research is
needed to find ways to mitigate AFM1 contamination through working with farmers
and milk processors both in the formal and informal sectors.

We assessed whether informing female sex workers about the availability of HIV
self-testing at clinics in Kenya using text messages would increase HIV testing
rates. We selected a sample of 2196 female sex workers registered in an
electronic health record system who were irregular HIV testers and randomized
them to be sent a text message announcing the availability of (1) HIV self-test
kits sent three times (intervention), (2) general HIV testing sent three times
(enhanced standard of care [SOC]), or (3) general HIV testing sent one time
(traditional SOC). Participants in the intervention arm were significantly more
likely to test for HIV during 2-month follow-up compared to those in the enhanced
SOC (OR 1.9, p = 0.001). There was no difference in HIV testing between those in 
the enhanced SOC and the traditional SOC arms. Announcing the availability of HIV
self-testing via text message increased HIV testing among this high-risk group.

The River Nzoia basin is the main source of water for domestic, agricultural, and
industrial activities. The levels of the priority polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water, soil, and sediments of River Nzoia during two
seasons are reported. The physico-chemical parameters gave levels that were
within the maximum allowable limit but with significant differences between the
wet and dry seasons (p < 0.005). In water (max: 0.092 ± 0.003 ng/L) and soils
(max 9.74 ± 1.97 ng/g), levels were significantly higher in the wet season unlike
in sediment (8.94 ± 3.33 ng/g). Although all levels were below the recommended
limits, the results form a need basis for continuous monitoring as recommended by
WHO and USEPA.

Key message Major stem rust resistance QTLs proposed to be Rpg2 from Hietpas-5
and Rpg3 from GAW-79 were identified in chromosomes 2H and 5H, respectively, and 
will enhance the diversity of stem rust resistance in barley improvement
programs. Stem rust is a devastating disease of cereal crops worldwide. In barley
(Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare), the disease is caused by two pathogens: Puccinia 
graminis f. sp. secalis (Pgs) and Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt). In
North America, the stem rust resistance gene Rpg1 has protected barley from
serious losses for more than 60 years; however, widely virulent Pgt races from
Africa in the Ug99 group threaten the crop. The accessions Hietpas-5 (CIho 7124) 
and GAW-79 (PI 382313) both possess moderate-to-high levels of adult plant
resistance to stem rust and are the sources of the resistance genes Rpg2 and
Rpg3, respectively. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stem rust
resistance in Hietpas-5 and GAW-79, two biparental populations were developed
with Hiproly (PI 60693), a stem rust-susceptible accession. Both populations were
phenotyped to the North American Pgt races of MCCFC, QCCJB, and HKHJC in St.
Paul, Minnesota, and to African Pgt races (predominately TTKSK in the Ug99 group)
in Njoro, Kenya. In the Hietpas-5/Hiproly population, a major effect QTL was
identified in chromosome 2H, which is proposed as the location for Rpg2. In the
GAW-79/Hiproly population, a major effect QTL was identified in chromosome 5H and
is the proposed location for Rpg3. These QTLs will enhance the diversity of stem 
rust resistance in barley improvement programs.

BACKGROUND: Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) has a viral aetiology and is
caused by viruses belonging to the genus Ipomovirus (family Potyviridae), Cassava
brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV).
Molecular and serological methods are available for detection, discrimination and
quantification of cassava brown streak viruses (CBSVs) in infected plants.
However, precise determination of the viral RNA localization in infected host
tissues is still not possible pending appropriate methods.
RESULTS: We have developed an in situ hybridization (ISH) assay based on
RNAscope® technology that allows the sensitive detection and localization of CBSV
RNA in plant tissues. The method was initially developed in the experimental host
Nicotiana rustica and was then further adapted to cassava. Highly sensitive and
specific detection of CBSV RNA was achieved without background and hybridization 
signals in sections prepared from non-infected tissues. The tissue tropism of
CBSV RNAs appeared different between N. rustica and cassava.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a robust method for CBSV detection in the
experimental host and in cassava. The protocol will be used to study CBSV tropism
in various cassava genotypes, as well as CBSVs/cassava interactions in single and
mixed infections.

Young children are infected by a diverse range of enteric pathogens in high
disease burden settings, suggesting pathogen contamination of the environment is 
equally diverse. This study aimed to characterize across- and within-neighborhood
diversity in enteric pathogen contamination of public domains in urban informal
settlements of Kisumu, Kenya, and to assess the relationship between pathogen
detection patterns and human and domestic animal sanitation conditions. Microbial
contamination of soil and surface water from 166 public sites in three Kisumu
neighborhoods was measured by enterococcal assays and quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for 19 enteric pathogens.
Regression was used to assess the association between observed sanitary
indicators of contamination with enterococci and pathogen presence and
concentration, and pathogen diversity. Seventeen types of pathogens were detected
in Kisumu public domains. Enteric pathogens were codetected in 33% of soil and
65% of surface water samples. Greater pathogen diversity was associated with the 
presence of domestic animal feces but not with human open defecation,
deteriorating latrines, flies, or disposal of human feces. Sanitary conditions
were not associated with enterococcal bacteria, specific pathogen concentrations,
or "any pathogen". Young children played at 40% of observed sites. Managing
domestic animal feces may be required to reduce enteric pathogen environmental
contamination in high-burden settings.

Artemisinin resistance is rapidly rising in Southeast Asia and may spread to
African countries, where efficacy estimates are currently still excellent.
Extensive monitoring of parasite clearance dynamics after treatment is needed to 
determine whether responsiveness to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT)
is changing in Africa. In this study, Kenyan children with uncomplicated
falciparum malaria were randomly assigned to pyronaridine-artesunate (PA) or
artemether-lumefantrine (AL) treatment. Parasite clearance was evaluated over 7
days following the start of treatment by qPCR and direct-on-blood PCR nucleic
acid lateral flow immunoassay (db-PCR-NALFIA), a simplified molecular malaria
diagnostic. Residual parasitemia at day 7 was detected by qPCR in 37.1% (26/70)
of AL-treated children and in 46.1% (35/76) of PA-treated participants (P =
0.275). Direct-on-blood PCR nucleic acid lateral flow immunoassay detected
residual parasites at day 7 in 33.3% (23/69) and 30.3% (23/76) of AL and
PA-treated participants, respectively (P = 0.692). qPCR-determined parasitemia at
day 7 was associated with increased prevalence and density of gametocytes at
baseline (P = 0.014 and P = 0.003, for prevalence and density, respectively) and 
during follow-up (P = 0.007 and P = 0.011, respectively, at day 7). A positive
db-PCR-NALFIA outcome at day 7 was associated with treatment failure (odds ratio 
[OR]: 3.410, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.513-7.689, P = 0.003), but this
association was not found for qPCR (OR: 0.701, 95% CI: 0.312-1.578, P = 0.391).
Both qPCR and db-PCR-NALFIA detected substantial residual submicroscopic
parasitemia after microscopically successful PA and AL treatment and can be
useful tools to monitor parasite clearance. To predict treatment outcome,
db-PCR-NALFIA may be more suitable than qPCR.

Epidemiologic data indicate a global distribution of anthrax outbreaks associated
with certain ecosystems that promote survival and viability of Bacillus anthracis
spores. Here, we characterized three anthrax outbreaks involving humans,
livestock, and wildlife that occurred in the same locality in Kenya between 2014 
and 2017. Clinical and epidemiologic data on the outbreaks were collected using
active case finding and review of human, livestock, and wildlife health records. 
Information on temporal and spatial distribution of prior outbreaks in the area
was collected using participatory epidemiology. The 2014-2017 outbreaks in Nakuru
West subcounty affected 15 of 71 people who had contact with infected cattle
(attack rate = 21.1%), including seven with gastrointestinal, six with cutaneous,
and two with oropharyngeal forms of the disease. Two (13.3%) gastrointestinal
human anthrax cases died. No human cases were associated with infected wildlife. 
Of the 54 cattle owned in 11 households affected, 20 died (attack rate = 37%).
The 2015 outbreak resulted in death of 10.5% of the affected herbivorous wildlife
at Lake Nakuru National Park, including 745 of 4,500 African buffaloes
(species-specific mortality rate = 17%) and three of 18 endangered white rhinos
(species-specific mortality rate = 16%). The species mortality rate ranged from
1% to 5% for the other affected wildlife species. Participatory epidemiology
identified prior outbreaks between 1973 and 2011 in the same area. The frequency 
and severity of outbreaks in this area suggests that it is an anthrax hotspot
ideal for investigating risk factors associated with long-term survival of
anthrax spores and outbreak occurrence.

The tsetse fly Glossina pallidipes, the major vector of the parasite that causes 
animal African trypanosomiasis in Kenya, has been subject to intense control
measures with only limited success. The G. pallidipes population dynamics and
dispersal patterns that underlie limited success in vector control campaigns
remain unresolved, and knowledge on genetic connectivity can provide insights,
and thereby improve control and monitoring efforts. We therefore investigated the
population structure and estimated migration and demographic parameters in G.
pallidipes using genotypic data from 11 microsatellite loci scored in 250 tsetse 
flies collected from eight localities in Kenya. Clustering analysis identified
two genetically distinct eastern and western clusters (mean between-cluster FST =
0.202) separated by the Great Rift Valley. We also found evidence of admixture
and migration between the eastern and western clusters, isolation by distance,
and a widespread signal of inbreeding. We detected differences in population
dynamics and dispersal patterns between the western and eastern clusters. These
included lower genetic diversity (allelic richness; 7.48 versus 10.99), higher
relatedness (percent related individuals; 21.4% versus 9.1%), and greater genetic
differentiation (mean within-cluster FST; 0.183 versus 0.018) in the western than
the eastern cluster. Findings are consistent with the presence of smaller, less
well-connected populations in Western relative to eastern Kenya. These data
suggest that recent anthropogenic influences such as land use changes and vector 
control programs have influenced population dynamics in G. pallidipes in Kenya,
and that vector control efforts should include some region-specific strategies to
effectively control this disease vector.

Ticks are important disease vectors in Kenya with documented evidence of carriage
of zoonotic pathogens. Coxiella burnetii is an important tick-borne pathogen that
is underreported in Kenya and yet this infection likely contributes to
undiagnosed febrile disease in pastoral communities. Archived human blood (278)
and tick pool samples (380) collected from five pastoral communities in Kenya
were screened for C. burnetii by PCR using primers targeting the transposon-like 
IS1111 region. All the human blood samples were negative for C. burnetii DNA.
However, C. burnetii was detected in 5.53% (21/380) of the tick pools tested.
Four of the twenty-one PCR positive samples were sequenced. The findings indicate
that Coxiella burnetii was not present in the human blood samples tested.
However, C. burnetii was detected in ticks from Mai Mahiu, Marigat, Ijara,
Isiolo, and Garissa indicating a natural infection present in the tick vector
that poses a risk to livestock and humans in these communities.

Pyrethrins are effective food-grade bio-pesticides obtained from the flowers of
Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and this crop cannot be cultivated widely in India
due to its specific agro-climatic requirement. Hence pyrethrins are mostly
imported from Kenya. Therefore, the present study aims to develop a process for
augmentation of pyrethrin contents in C. cinerariaefolium callus and establish
the correlation between early knockdown effects through docking on grain storage 
insect. In vitro seedlings were used as explants to induce callus on MS medium
with different concentrations of auxins and cytokinins. Pyrethrin extracted from 
the callus was estimated by RP-HPLC. In callus, total pyrethrin was found to be
17.5 µg/g, which is higher than that found in natural flowers of certain
Pyrethrum cultivars. The concentrations of cinerin II, pyrethrin II and jasmoline
II were quite high in callus grown on solid medium. Bio-efficacy of pyrethrum
extracts of flower and callus on insect Tribolium sp., showed higher repellency
and early knock-down effect when compared with pure compound pestanal. Further,
the rapid knockdown effect of all pyrethrins components was established by
molecular docking studies targeting NavMS Sodium Channel Pore receptor docking
followed by multiple ligands simultaneous docking, performed to investigate the
concurrent binding of different combinations of pyrethrin. Among the six
pyrethrin components, the pyrethrin I and II were found to be a more efficient,
binding more firmly to the target, exhibiting higher possibilities of
insecticidal effect by an early knockdown mechanism.

Background: Humanitarian emergencies increase the risk of gender-based violence
(GBV). We estimated the prevalence of GBV victimisation and perpetration among
women and men in urban settings across Somalia, which has faced decades of war
and natural disasters that have resulted in massive population displacements.
Methods: A population-based survey was conducted in 14 urban areas across Somalia
between December 2014 and November 2015.
Results: A total of 2376 women and 2257 men participated in the survey. One in
five men (22.2%, 95% CI 20.5 to 23.9) and one in seven (15.5%; 95% CI 14.1 to
17.0) women reported physical or sexual violence victimisation during childhood. 
Among women, 35.6% (95% CI 33.4 to 37.9) reported adult lifetime experiences of
physical or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) and 16.5% (95% CI 15.1 to
18.1) reported adult lifetime experience of physical or sexual non-partner
violence (NPV). Almost one-third of men (31.2%; 95% CI 29.4 to 33.1) reported
victimisation as an adult, the majority of which was physical violence.
Twenty-two per cent (21.7%; 95% CI 19.5 to 24.1) of men reported lifetime sexual 
or physical IPV perpetration and 8.1% (95% CI 7.1 to 9.3) reported lifetime
sexual or physical NPV perpetration. Minority clan membership, displacement,
exposure to parental violence and violence during childhood were common
correlates of IPV and NPV victimisation and perpetration among women and men.
Victimisation and perpetration were also strongly associated with recent
depression and experiences of miscarriage or stillbirth.
Conclusion: GBV is prevalent and spans all regions of Somalia. Programmes that
support nurturing environments for children and provide health and psychosocial
support for women and men are critical to prevent and respond to GBV.

Introduction: In underserved populations, the contribution of community health
workers (CHWs) is vital to the healthcare systems. Attrition of these workers
causes critical breakdowns in the delivery of essential services to these
populations. Literature on reasons for attrition is limited, although some have
been identified in studies on sustainability of CHW programmes. These factors
are, however, likely to be influenced by context. We measured CHW attrition and
its predictors in a rural area in Kenya.
Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study and focus group discussions
among CHWs involved in a maternal and child health project. A training register
of 1005 CHWs was used to sample and follow CHWs for attrition. Incidence of CHW
attrition was calculated using a Poisson model. Separately, we used logistic
regression to determine predictors of CHW attrition.
Results: Of the 1005 CHWs, 498 (49.6%) had left the project by the time of the
study. The incidence of attrition was 46.8/1000 person-years (95% CI 38.7 to
56.5). In the case-control study, lack of interest in peer organisation
membership (OR 5.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 20.6) was associated with attrition. Absence of
refresher training (OR 4.0; 95% CI 2.2 to 7.1) and receiving no feedback from
supervisors (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.9) were also associated with attrition.
Discordance in expectations and perceived heavy workload were also identified as 
key reasons for attrition in the qualitative study.
Conclusion: This study estimates high prevalence and incidence of CHW attrition
in Kwale County, Kenya. Ongoing training, feedback and peer support are also
important in enhancing retention of CHWs. Additionally, expectations regarding
the roles and benefits of involvement in CHW work should be communicated clearly,
and workload should be kept reasonable or negotiated with the CHWs.

BACKGROUND: Increased use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) over the last
decade has considerably improved the control of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.
However, there is still a paucity of data on the influence of LLIN use and other 
factors on mosquito bionomics in different epidemiological foci. The objective of
this study was to provide updated data on the evolution of vector bionomics and
malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region of Cameroon over
the period 2000-2017, during which LLIN coverage has increased substantially.
METHODS: The study was conducted in Olama and Nyabessan, two villages situated in
the equatorial forest region. Mosquito collections from 2016-2017 were compared
to those of 2000-2001. Mosquitoes were sampled using both human landing catches
and indoor sprays, and were identified using morphological taxonomic keys.
Specimens belonging to the An. gambiae complex were further identified using
molecular tools. Insecticide resistance bioassays were undertaken on An. gambiae 
to assess the susceptibility levels to both permethrin and deltamethrin.
Mosquitoes were screened for Plasmodium falciparum infection and blood-feeding
preference using the ELISA technique. Parasitological surveys in the population
were conducted to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium infection using rapid
diagnostic tests.
RESULTS: A change in the species composition of sampled mosquitoes was recorded
between the 2000-2001 collections and those of 2016-2017. A drop in the density
of the local primary vectors An. nili and An. moucheti in the forest region was
recorded, whereas there was an increase in the density of An. gambiae (s.l.), An.
marshallii, An. ziemannii and An. paludis. A change in the biting behaviour from 
indoor to outdoor was recorded in Olama. Very few indoor resting mosquitoes were 
collected. A change in the night biting cycle was recorded with mosquitoes
displaying a shift from night biting to late evening/early in the night. Several 
mosquitoes were found positive for Plasmodium infection, thus sustaining
continuous transmission of malaria in both sites. Reduction of malaria
transmission in Nyabessan was lower than that seen in Olama and associated with
deforestation and the construction of a dam that may have enabled a more
efficient vector, An. gambiae (s.l.), to invade the area. A high level of
resistance to pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) was detected for An.
gambiae in both sites. High parasite prevalence was recorded in both sites, with 
children of 0-16 years being the most affected. In both Olama and Nyabessan, bed 
net usage appeared to correlate to protection against malaria infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows important changes in the bionomics of vector
populations and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region.
The changes call for more concerted efforts to address challenges such as
insecticide resistance, environmental modifications or behavioural changes
affecting the performance of current control measures.

African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease manifesting clinical
symptoms of hemorrhagic fever caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV) and
leads to almost 100% mortality in domestic pigs (Galindo and Alonso, 2017, Quembo
et al., 2018). Since ASF was first identified in Kenya in the 1920s, it has
rapidly spread in Africa and Eurasia and presented as 24 genotypes (Galindo and
Alonso, 2017, Quembo et al., 2018). For instance, a genotype II ASFV derived from
eastern Africa has resulted in substantial economic losses in many Eastern and
Western European countries (van Heerden et al., 2017). This article is protected

Campylobacteriosis is a leading foodborne zoonosis worldwide, and is frequently
associated with handling and consumption of poultry meat. Various studies
indicate that Campylobacter causes a substantial human disease burden in low to
middle-income countries, but data regarding the organism's epidemiology in
countries like Kenya are scarce. In sub-Saharan Africa, 3.8 million deaths of
children under-5 years of age are reported annually. Of those, 25% are caused by 
diarrheal diseases, and Campylobacter is one of the most frequently isolated
bacteria from diarrheic children. With the growth of urban conglomerates, such as
Kenya's capital, Nairobi, changes in diets, food production systems, and
retailing dynamics, it is likely that exposure and susceptibility to this
pathogen will change. Therefore, the importance of Campylobacter disease burden
in Kenya may increase further. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine
the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in Nairobi's small-scale chicken farms and
meat retailers, and 2) to identify potential risk factors associated with its
presence in those sites. The prevalence data provides the first detailed baseline
for this pathogen in the urban Kenyan context. The risk factors provide
context-specific insights for disease managers. A cross-sectional study of
broiler, indigenous chicken farms, and chicken meat retailers, was conducted in a
peri-urban, low to middle-income area (Dagoretti), and a very-low income informal
settlement (Kibera) of Nairobi. Chicken faeces were collected using one pair of
boot socks per farm, and 3 raw chicken meat samples were purchased per retailer. 
Samples were cultured for viable Campylobacter spp. using mCCDA, followed by
blood agar plates in aerobic/microaerobic conditions for prevalence calculations.
A questionnaire-based survey on sanitary, sourcing and selling practices was
conducted at each site for risk factor identification using logistic regression
analyses. A total of 171 farm premises and 53 retailers were sampled and
interviewed. The prevalence results for Campylobacter spp. were between 33 to 44%
for broiler and indigenous chicken farms, 60% and 64% for retailers, in Dagoretti
and Kibera, respectively. Univariable logistic regression showed an association
between Campylobacter spp. presence and the easiness of cleaning the display
material used by the retailer. Restricting access to the flock was also
associated with the pathogen's presence. Multivariable logistic regression
identified the selling of defrosted meat as a retailer risk factor (OR: 4.69; 95%
CI: 1.31-19.97), calling for more investigation of the reported repetitive
freezing-thawing processes and cold chain improvement options. At the farm-level,
having a pen floor of material not easy to clean was found to increase the risk
(OR: 2.31; 95%CI: 1.06-5.37). The relatively high prevalence of Campylobacter
spp. across different areas and value chain nodes indicates a clear human
exposure risk. The open nature of both small-scale broiler and indigenous chicken
production practices with low biosecurity, hygiene and informal transactions,
likely plays a role in this. While gradual improvement of farm biosecurity is
recommended, risk factors identified suggest that consumer education and
enforcement of basic food safety principles at the retailer end of the food
continuum represent key targets for risk reduction in informal settings.

A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk
factors of Cryptosporidium infection and identify species of the parasite in
cattle in central Ethiopia. Faecal samples, collected from 392 dairy cattle
managed under intensive and extensive production system, were analyzed by the
Modified Ziehl-Neelsen (MZN) microscopy, Nested PCR, PCR-RFLP and sequence
analyses of the SSU rRNA gene of Cryptosporidium. The overall prevalence, the
prevalence in the extensive and intensive farms was 18.6%, 11% and 21%,
respectively. The infection was detected in 37.7% of the investigated farms with 
prevalence range of 7.4% -100%, and all of the six surveyed districts with
significant (P = 0.000) prevalence difference. Restriction digestion and sequence
analysis showed Cryptosporidium parvum and C. andersoni in 27% and 73% of the
infections, respectively, showing an age related distribution pattern, C. parvum 
exclusively occurring in calves <2 months old and C. andersoni only in heifers
and adult cattle. The infection was significantly associated with management
system, farm location, herd size, source of drinking water, weaning age, presence
of bedding, pen cleanness and cleanness of hindquarter. In conclusion,
Cryptosporidium infection due to C. parvum and C. andersoni was prevalent in
cattle in the study area. Cryptosporidium parvum has the concern of public health
importance, especially to farm workers and people in close contact with cattle.
Instigation of imperative control measure is suggested to lessen the risk of
human infection and loss of production in dairy farms.

Introduction: Antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed medications in 
hospitalized patients, with up to half of prescriptions being irrational. This
study aimed to assess the quality of antibiotic use among surgical inpatients at 
our institution.
Methods: A one year (January 1-December 31, 2015) retrospective chart review on
antibiotic use for patients admitted to the surgical department at AIC Litein
Hospital, a faith based non-governmental health institution in Western Kenya, was
conducted. Data were collected from medical and nursing patient charts with a
standardized questionnaire. The criteria applied to assess inappropriate
antibiotic use focused on the choice, duration and indication of the antibiotics 
prescribed.
Results: A total of 394 cases were evaluated, with a mean age of 44.8 years and a
mean duration of hospitalization of 7.2 days. Antibiotics were initiated either
for prophylaxis (205, 56.3%) or treatment (159, 43.7%) for a mean duration of 6
days (range 1-37). The predominant route of administration was intravenous (332, 
91.2%). Most antibiotics started at admission were continued till discharge and
the duration of antibiotics was indicated in only 11% of the treatment sheets. At
discharge, 321 (81.4%) cases had antibiotics prescribed for a mean duration of
5.7 days (range 1-60). Inappropriate prescriptions were noted in 45.4% of
prophylactic antibiotics, 33.4% treatment antibiotics and 52.6% of discharge
antibiotics. The most common reason for inappropriate antibiotic use during
hospitalization was inappropriate duration (45.9%).
Conclusion: Proper documentation, daily antibiotic review and preparation of a
local antibiotic policy guideline could help improve the appropriate use of
antibiotics.

Introduction: Snake bites are a silent public health problem in Kenya. Previous
studies on snake bites in the country have mainly focused on identifying
offending snake species, assessing the severity of envenomation and testing the
efficacy of antivenom. Factors associated with snake bites in the country are yet
to be fully understood. The aim of this work was to determine
pharmaco-epidemiological factors associated with snake bites in areas of Kenya
where incidence, severity and species responsible for snake bites have been
reported.
Methods: Kakamega provincial hospital, Kabarnet, Kapenguria and, Makueni district
hospitals were selected as study sites based on previous findings on incidence,
severity and species responsible for snake bites in catchment areas of these
hospitals. Persistent newspaper reports of snake bites in these areas and
distribution of snakes in Kenya were also considered. Cases of snake bites
reported between 2007-2009 were retrospectively reviewed and data on incidence,
age, site of the bites, time of bite and antivenom use was collected.
Results: 176 bites were captured, 91 of which occurred in 2009. Individual
incidence was between 2.7/100,000/year and 6.7/100,000/year. Bites peaked in the 
1-15 year age group while 132/176 bites were in the lower limb area and 49/176
victims received antivenom. Most bites occurred during the dry season, in the
bush and in the evening. Overall mortality was 2.27%.
Conclusion: There is a need to sensitize the Kenyan public and healthcare
personnel on preventive measures, first aid and treatment of snake bites.

The ecological importance of the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) in 
aquatic ecosystems is becoming increasingly well known. These unique
megaherbivores are also likely to have a formative influence on the terrestrial
ecosystems in which they forage. In this study, we employed a novel exclosure
design to exclude H. amphibius from experimental plots on near-river grasslands. 
Our three-year implementation of this experiment revealed a substantial influence
of H. amphibius removal on both plant communities and soil chemistry. H.
amphibius significantly reduced grassland canopy height, increased the leafiness 
of common grasses, reduced woody plant abundance and size, and increased the
concentrations of several soil elements. Many of the soil chemistry changes that 
we experimentally induced by exclusion of H. amphibius were mirrored in the soil 
chemistry differences between naturally occurring habitats of frequent (grazing
lawns) and infrequent (shrub forest) use by H. amphibius and other grazing
herbivores. In contrast to existing hypotheses regarding grazing species, we
found that H. amphibius had little effect on local plant species richness.
Simultaneous observations of exclosures designed to remove all large herbivores
revealed that H. amphibius removal had ecologically significant impacts, but that
the removal of all species of large herbivores generated more pronounced impacts 
than the removal of H. amphibius alone. In aggregate, our results suggest that H.
amphibius have myriad effects on their terrestrial habitats that likely improve
the quality of forage available for other herbivores. We suggest that ongoing
losses of this vulnerable megaherbivore are likely to cause significant
ecological change.

OBJECTIVES: This research paper analyses how applying a Place-Based Leadership
Development (P-BLD) programme adds value to an ongoing intersectoral Urban
Violence Prevention Programme (IUVP) in Kenya building trust within
collaboratives in the intersection between the historically adversarial law
enforcement and civil society sectors.
METHODS: Data on participants' experience of the P-BLD programme were
systematically collected through detailed pre- and post-session questionnaires
which included a series of challenging but open questions. A framework analysis
was undertaken to draw out the common themes.
RESULTS: By surfacing emotional, relational and structural tensions between law
enforcement and civil society within the context of IUVP, the P-BLD programme has
enabled leaders to become more open to and respecting others' perspectives as a
first step towards a more collaborative mindset.
CONCLUSIONS: The P-BLD programme is having a positive impact, explicitly
addressing the tensions and enabling leaders to share their concerns and
challenges in working towards violence prevention at the intersection between law
enforcement and civil society. Moreover, this approach is replicable creating new
knowledge and sustainable mechanisms for violence prevention within urban areas
across the world.

The abundance of banana flower thrips (Thrips hawaiiensis Morgan) in a banana
(Musa acuminata Colla "Williams" cultivar) plantation was investigated using
yellow sticky traps (29.70 cm × 21.00 cm) in 2015. Banana flower thrips occurred 
throughout the year with monthly variation, and the maximum occurrence was
observed in October and November during the bud burst (73.80 ± 6.32 adults/trap) 
and young fruit (70.06 ± 5.69 adults/trap) periods. The damage rates were as
follows: interior flowers >3rd-layer flowers > 2nd-layer flowers > 1st-layer
flowers > young fruits. This result indicates that thrips migrated to lower
bracts, young fruits, and other flower buds as bracts gradually opened. Results
also showed that the reducing sugar, vitamin C, protein and ash contents in
thrips-damaged flowers were all significantly lower than those in undamaged
flowers, while there was no significant difference between damaged and undamaged 
young banana fruit. Our results indicated that the abundances of banana flower
thrips were closely associated with the growing stage of banana. Thrips mainly
infested flower buds and caused a reduction in nutrients for the host plant,
especially the reducing sugar and vitamin C contents, which reduced the
nutritional quality of banana fruits and the quality of flower bud by-products of
banana.

OBJECTIVE: To assess changes and equity in antiretroviral therapy (ART) use in
Kenya and South Africa.
METHODS: We analysed national population-based household surveys conducted in
Kenya and South Africa between 2007 and 2012 for factors associated with lack of 
ART use among people living with HIV (PLHIV) aged 15-64 years. We considered ART 
use to be inequitable if significant differences in use were found between groups
of PLHIV (e.g. by sex).
FINDINGS: ART use among PLHIV increased from 29.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]:
22.8-35.8) to 42.5% (95%CI: 37.4-47.7) from 2007 to 2012 in Kenya and 17.4%
(95%CI: 14.2-20.9) to 30.3% (95%CI: 27.2-33.6) from 2008 to 2012 in South Africa.
In 2012, factors independently associated with lack of ART use among adult Kenyan
PLHIV were rural residency (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.98, 95%CI: 1.23-3.18),
younger age (15-24 years: aOR 4.25, 95%CI: 1.7-10.63, and 25-34 years: aOR 5.16, 
95%CI: 2.73-9.74 versus 50-64 years), nondisclosure of HIV status to most recent 
sex partner (aOR 2.41, 95%CI: 1.27-4.57) and recent recreational drug use (aOR
2.50, 95%CI: 1.09-5.77). Among South African PLHIV in 2012, lack of ART use was
significantly associated with younger age (15-24 years: aOR 4.23, 95%CI:
2.56-6.70, and 25-34 years: aOR 2.84, 95%CI: 1.73-4.67, versus 50-64 years),
employment status (aOR 1.61, 95%CI: 1.16-2.23 in students versus unemployed), and
recent recreational drug use (aOR 4.56, 95%CI: 1.79-11.57).
CONCLUSION: Although we found substantial increases in ART use in both countries 
over time, we identified areas needing improvement including among rural Kenyans,
students in South Africa, and among young people and drug users in both
countries.

BACKGROUND: To date, little information exists on the costs of providing
antiretroviral therapy (ART) within maternal and child health (MCH) clinics in
Kenya. The main objective of this analysis was to estimate the annual incremental
cost of providing ART within a MCH clinic for adult women initiated on ART during
pregnancy over the first one and two years on treatment. The study site was the
District Hospital in Kericho, Kenya.
METHODS: A micro-costing approach from the provider's perspective, based on a
retrospective review of patient medical records, was used to evaluate incremental
costs of care (2012 USD). Cost per patient in two cohorts were evaluated: the MCH
clinic group comprised of adult women who initiated ART at the site's MCH clinic 
during pregnancy between 2008-2011; and for comparison, the ART clinic group
comprised of adult, non-pregnant women who initiated ART at the site's ART clinic
during 2008-2011. The two groups were matched on age and baseline CD4 count at
initiation. Retention at year one/two on ART was defined as having completed a
clinic visit at 365/730 days on ART +/- 90 days.
RESULTS: For patients defined as retained in care at year one, average
incremental costs per patient were $234 for the MCH clinic group (median: 215;
IQR: 186, 282) and $292 in the ART clinic group (median: 227; IQR: 178, 357). ARV
and laboratory costs were less on average for the MCH clinic group compared to
the ART clinic group (due to lower cost regimens and fewer tests), while
personnel costs were higher for the MCH clinic group.
CONCLUSIONS: The annual incremental cost per patient of providing ART were
similar in the two clinic settings in 2012. With shifts in recommended ARV
regimens and lab monitoring over time, annual costs of care (using 2016 USD unit 
costs) have remained relatively constant in nominal terms for the MCH clinic
group but have fallen substantially for the ART clinic group (from nominal $292
in 2012 to nominal $227 in 2016).

AIM: The aim was to explore contraceptive uptake, associated factors and
satisfaction among post abortion-care (PAC) seeking women in Kenya. Due to unsafe
abortions, almost 120 000 Kenyan women received PAC in 2012, and of these women, 
70% did not use contraception before pregnancy.
METHODS: This study was nested in a larger randomised controlled trial, where 859
women sought PAC at two public hospitals in Kisumu, in June 2013-May 2016. The
women were randomly assigned to a midwife or a physician for PAC, including
contraceptive counselling, and followed up at 7-10 days and three months.
Associated factors for contraceptive uptake were analysed with binary logistic
regression, and contraceptive method choice, adherence and satisfaction level
were examined by descriptive statistics, using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,
Version 22.0.
RESULTS: Out of the 810 PAC-seeking women, 76% (n = 609) accepted the use of
contraception. Age groups of 21-25 (OR: 2.35; p < 0.029) and 26-30 (OR: 2.22; p <
0.038), and previous experience of 1-2 gravidities (OR 1.939; p = 0.018) were
independent factors associated with the up-take. Methods used: injections 39% (n 
= 236); pills 27% (n = 166); condoms 25% (n = 151); implant 7% (n = 45) and
intrauterine device (IUD) 1% (n = 8). At 3-month follow-up of the women (470/609;
77%), 354 (75%) women still used contraception, and most (n = 332; 94%) were
satisfied with the method. Reasons for discontinuation were side-effects (n = 44;
39%), partner refusal (n = 27; 24%), planned pregnancy (n = 27; 24%) and lack of 
resupplies (n = 15; 13%).
CONCLUSIONS: PAC-seeking women seem highly motivated to use contraceptives, yet a
quarter decline the use, and at 3-month follow-up a further quarter among the
users had discontinued. Implant, IUD and permanent method are rarely used.
Strategies to improve contraceptive counselling, particularly to adolescent
girls, and to increase access to a wide range of methods, as well as provider
training and supervision may help to improve contraceptive acceptance and
compliance among PAC-seeking women in Kisumu, Kenya.

of HIV testing.

BACKGROUND: Substantial concern exists about the high risk of sexually
transmitted HIV to adolescent girls and young women (AGYW, ages 15-24) in Eastern
and Southern Africa. Yet limited research has been conducted with AGYW's male
sexual partners regarding their perspectives on relationships and strategies for 
mitigating HIV risk. We sought to fill this gap in order to inform the DREAMS
Partnership and similar HIV prevention programs in Uganda.
METHODS: We conducted 94 in-depth interviews, from April-June 2017, with male
partners of AGYW in three districts: Gulu, Mukono, and Sembabule. Men were
recruited at community venues identified as potential transmission areas, and via
female partners enrolled in DREAMS. Analyses focused on men's current and recent 
partnerships and HIV service use.
RESULTS: Most respondents (80%) were married and 28 years old on average. Men saw
partner concurrency as pervasive, and half described their own current multiple
partners. Having married in their early 20s, over time most men continued to seek
out AGYW as new partners, regardless of their own age. Relationships were highly 
fluid, with casual short-term partnerships becoming more formalized, and more
formalized partnerships characterized by periods of separation and outside
partnerships. Nearly all men reported recent HIV testing and described testing at
distinct relationship points (e.g., when deciding to continue a relationship/get 
married, or when reuniting with a partner after a separation). Testing often
stemmed from distrust of partner behavior, and an HIV-negative status served to
validate respondents' current relationship practices.
CONCLUSIONS: Across the three regions in Uganda, findings with partners of AGYW
confirm earlier reports in Uganda of multiple concurrent partnerships, and
demonstrate substantial HIV testing. Yet they also unearth the degree to which
these partnerships are fluid (switching between casual and/or more long-term
partnerships), which complicates potential HIV prevention strategies.
Context-specific findings around these partnerships and risk are critical to
further tailor HIV prevention programs.

SportAccord organized the inaugural HealthAccord conference on April 19, 2018, in
Bangkok, Thailand. The goal of HealthAccord is for the International Sport
Federations (IF) and sport industry leaders to address high-priority issues
facing sport through a serious commitment to innovation to protect athlete
health, to enhance athlete performance, and to stimulate action to improve global
health through the promotion of physical activity. The first HeathAccord
conference was organized by drawing on the knowledge and experience of experts
from global health programs focused on athletes and global citizens,
respectively. The first session, "The Power of Sport," addressed the application 
of "state of the art" sport science and sport medicine for the protection of
athlete health and to enhance sport performance. "The Power of Sport" session
concentrated on enabling athletes to perform spectacular feats that are "higher, 
stronger, faster" intended to engage and thrill global audiences without
resorting to prohibited substances and methods, to enable athletes to remain
active in sport for a longer career, and to increase the attraction of sport for 
sponsors. In the second session, "The Power to Change," sport was viewed as
having an important role in promoting physical activity within their respective
federations, community, and internationally. The Olympic movement, IF, and other 
sport stakeholders are urgently needed to become the social drivers to correct
the mismatch between physical activity for health development and draw toward
sedentary lifestyles of the modern world. Key outcomes of this first HealthAccord
conference were the agreement among participants to develop an innovative and
high-impact collaboration between IF and related stakeholders; to use sport as a 
social movement platform to measurably improve health, both for athletes and for 
global citizens.

Nanostructured mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles with high specific
surface area and average crystallite domain sizes within 2 nm and 30 nm have been
prepared via the sol-gel and hydrothermal procedures. The characteristics of
produced nanoparticles have been tested using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD),
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopy 
(SEM), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR), and Raman Spectroscopy as a function
of temperature for their microstructural, porosity, morphological, structural and
absorption properties. The as-synthesized TiO2 nanostructures were attempted as
catalysts in Rhodamine B and Sudan III dyes' photocatalytic decomposition in a
batch reactor with the assistance of Ultra Violet (UV) light. The results show
that for catalysts calcined at 300 °C, ∼100 % decomposition of Sudan III dye was 
observed when Hydrothermal based catalyst was used whiles ∼94 % decomposition of 
Rhodamine B dye was observed using the sol-gel based catalysts. These synthesized
TiO2 nanoparticles have promising potential applications in the light aided
decomposition of a wide range of dye pollutants.

Exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP), an important cause of interstitial lung
disease, often goes unrecognized. We conducted a retrospective study of children 
with histologically confirmed ELP at Red Cross Children's Hospital, South Africa.
Twelve children of Zimbabwean heritage aged 2.1-10.8 months were identified
between 2012 and 2017. Repeated oral administration of plant-based oil for
cultural reasons was reported by 10 of 11 caregivers. Cough (12/12), tachypnoea
(11/12), hypoxia (9/12), and diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest radiography
(12/12) were common at presentation. Chest computed tomography revealed
ground-glass opacification with lower zone predominance (9/9) and interlobular
septal thickening (8/9). Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens appeared cloudy/milky, 
with abundant lipid-laden macrophages and extracellular lipid on Oil-Red-O
staining (12/12), with polymicrobial (6/12) and Mycobacterium abscessus (2/12)
co-infection. Antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, and therapeutic lavage were 
interventions in all eight and five patients, respectively. Clinicians should
consider ELP in children with non-resolving pneumonia in settings with similar
practices.

BACKGROUND: Human animal-bite injuries are a serious public health problem due to
associated risk for rabies virus exposure. Animal-bite injuries especially dog
bites are useful indicators for assessing the risk of rabies virus transmission
and need for rabies post exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Understanding the
epidemiology and surveillance of animal bites and rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis is critical in implementing Kenya's national rabies elimination
strategy. We aimed to describe the incidence of human animal-bite injuries,
patient/biting animal characteristics, uptake of rabies PEP and factors
associated with animal bite incidents.
METHODS: We reviewed animal bite records from outpatient and anti-rabies vaccine 
(ARV) registers of 17 health facilities from five counties. An animal bite was
defined as an entry of an animal bite of the class mammal including humans in
registers in a person of any age from January 2011 to December 2016. We collected
demographic and information on PEP uptake. We calculated descriptive statistics, 
odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to examine factors associated
with being an animal bite case-patient. We also calculated incidence of animal
bites using health facility catchment population for year 2016 as the
denominator.
RESULTS: We analyzed 7307 records. The median age was 22 years (IQR = 31 years); 
there were 4019 (55%) male and age < 15 years were 2607 (37%). Dogs accounted for
6720 (93%) of bites of which 78% were owned free-roaming dogs. Of the 5674 (88%) 
cases that received rabies PEP, 2247 (40%) got at least three-doses. The median
time from bite to seeking medical care was 2 days (IQR = 4 days). Being bitten on
the head/face (OR = 5.8; CI: 3.3-10.2); being bitten by owned free-roaming dog
(OR = 1.7; CI: 1.5-1.9) and being male (OR = 1.4; CI: 1.3-1.5) were significantly
associated with being an animal-bite case-patient. Being male, being bitten on
head/face and being bitten by owned free-roaming dog remained independently
associated with being an animal bite case-patient at multivariable logistic
regression. Bite-incidence was 289 bites /100,000 persons among all counties.
CONCLUSION: Preventing dog bites would most effectively reduce bite injuries by
improving public health education among children below 15 years, encouraging
early PEP initiation and completion, development and implementation of
responsible dog ownership and animal behaviour educational programmes as well as 
improving human and veterinary health linkages.

BACKGROUND: Passive surveillance of malaria in health facilities remains vital
for implementation of control and elimination programs. It is therefore essential
understanding current age profile of clinical malaria morbidity, mortality and
presentations in areas with variant infection susceptibility. This study aimed at
understanding the current malaria morbidity and mortality in Western Kenya.
METHODS: Surveillance of clinical and asymptomatic parasitological positivity
rates of all malaria suspected patients and school children were respectively
determined from June 2015 to August 2016. From 2014 to 2016, register books in
hospitals were referred and the confirmed malaria cases in conjunction with total
number of monthly outpatient visits (OPD) counted. All registered malaria
admissions were counted together with other causes of admissions. Moreover,
outcome of malaria admissions in terms of discharge or death was recorded using
inpatient charts within the same time frame. Prospective surveillance of severe
malaria collected information on clinical features of the disease. Giemsa stained
blood slides confirmed existence of malaria parasitemia. Chi-square and analysis 
of variance tests were used, respectively, to compute proportions and means; then
a comparison was made between different age groups, periods, and study areas.
RESULTS: During the survey of asymptomatic infections among school children,
overall blood slide positivity ranged from 6.4% at the epidemic prone site to
38.3% at the hyperendemic site. During the clinical malaria survey, school age
children (5-14) presented with overall the highest (45%) blood slide positivity
rate among those suspected to have the infection at the epidemic prone study
site. The survey of all malaria confirmed and registered cases at OPD found 17%
to 27% of all consultations among <5 children and 9.9% to 20.7% of all OPD visits
among the ≥5 patients were due to malaria. Moreover, survey of all registered
causes of admission in hospitals found 47% of admissions were due to malaria. The
disease was a major cause of admission in epidemic prone setting where 63.4% of
the <5 children and 62.8% of the ≥5 patients were admitted due to malaria
(p>0.05) and 40% of all malaria admissions were school age children. Malaria
related death rate was highest among <5 years at the hyperendemic site, that is
60.9 death per 1000 malaria <5 admissions. Conversely, the epidemic prone setting
experienced highest malaria related death among ≥15 years (18.6 death per 1000
admissions) than the < 15 years (5.7 death per 1000 admissions of the <15 years) 
(p< 0.001). Surveillance of severe form of the disease found that hyperpyrexia,
hyperparastemia, prostration and convulsions as common presentations of severe
disease.
CONCLUSION: Malaria is still the major cause of hospital consultations in Western
Kenya with an alarming number of severe forms of the disease among the school
aged children at the epidemic prone setting. Mortalities were higher among <5
children years in high infection transmission setting and among ≥15 years in low 
and moderate transmission settings. Surveillance of asymptomatic and symptomatic 
malaria along with evaluation of current interventions in different age groups
should be implemented in Kenya.

Background information: Domestic Violence (DV) is associated with serious
consequences to the survivor's physical, emotional, sexual, social and mental
well-being. DV screening ensures timely detection of violence and hence promotes 
timely intervention. This timely intervention has the potential of averting
adverse outcomes of DV to the survivor. Globally, the prevalence of DV among
women is 35% and in Kenya its 49% among women and 13.5% among pregnant women.
Despite the adverse outcome of DV in pregnancy, screening during pregnancy lags
behind in Kenya.
Purpose: To assess the nursing barriers to screening pregnant women for DV.
Methodology: A cross-sectional study of 125 nurses selected by random sampling
method was conducted at a National Maternity Hospital in Kenya. Data was
collected for 8 weeks using researchers developed structured questionnaire. Data 
was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0.
Chi-square test was used to determine significance of relationships between
nominal variables. A P-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: Study results revealed that 16% (n=8) of nurses routinely screened
pregnant women for DV. Non-screening behavior of nurses was associated with lack 
of DV screening training during their education program (P=0.002), fear of the
partner's reaction (P=0.004) and lack of mentors and role models in DV screening 
(P=0.005). Lack of cooperation from other health professionals was also
associated with non-screening of DV (P=0.016).
The significance of the study: The results of this study point to the need of
developing hospital's protocols on DV management and considering integrating DV
screening in the routine medical screening of pregnant women during antenatal
care.
Conclusion: The study showed that the nurse's prevalence of screening pregnant
women for DV is low at 16% due to various barriers.

BACKGROUND: Although electronic health information systems (EHIS) with
immunization components exist in Kenya, questions and concerns remain about their
use and alignment with the Kenya Ministry of Health's (MOH) National Vaccine and 
Immunization Program (NVIP). This article reports on the findings of an
assessment of select EHIS with immunization components in Kenya, specifically
related to system design, development, and implementation.
METHODS: We conducted a rapid assessment of select EHIS with immunization
components in Kenya from January to May 2017 to understand the design,
development, implementation of the EHIS including the lessons learned from their 
use. We also assessed how the data elements in the EHIS compared to the data
elements in the Maternal and Child Health Booklet used in the existing paper
based system in Kenya.
RESULTS: The EHIS reviewed varied in purpose, content, and population covered.
Only one system was built to focus specifically on immunization data. Substantial
differences in system functionality and immunization-related data elements
included in the EHIS were identified. None of the EHIS had all the data elements 
necessary to fully replace or operate independently from the standardized
paper-based system for recording immunization data in Kenya.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings of this assessment highlighted substantial
variation in the EHIS with immunization components. The findings provide insights
and lessons learned for the Kenya MOH NVIP, immunization partners, vendors of
EHIS, and users of EHIS to consider as Kenya transitions from paper-based to
electronic immunization information systems.

It is widely recognized that increasing agricultural production to the levels
needed to feed an expanding world population requires sharply increased public
investment in research and development and widespread adoption of new
technologies, but funding for national and international agricultural research
has rather declined in recent years. In this situation, priority setting has
become increasingly important for allocating scarce research resources among
competing needs to achieve greater impacts. Using partial equilibrium economic
surplus models and poverty impact simulations, this paper assesses cassava
research priorities in Africa, Latin America and Caribbean, and Asia based on the
potential economic and poverty reduction impacts of alternative research and
technology options. The results showed that efficient planting material
production and distribution systems and sustainable crop and soil fertility
management practices have the greatest expected economic and poverty reduction
impacts in the three regions. Lack of clean planting materials is a major
constraint to adoption and it is envisaged that efficient production and
distribution systems for planting material can accelerate technology adoption by 
farmers. Similarly, sustainable crop and soil fertility management practices play
a key role in closing the observed yield gaps, especially in Africa. The paper
discusses the results of the priority assessment for key cassava research options
and concludes with the implications for cassava research priorities.

BACKGROUND: Among the different faces of immune reconstitution inflammatory
syndrome (IRIS) developing in HIV-patients, no clinical definition has been
reported for Schistosomiasis-IRIS (Schisto-IRIS). Although Schisto-IRIS remains
largely uninvestigated, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and tissue inhibitors of 
metalloproteinases (TIMP) have previously been associated with S. mansoni
infection and tuberculosis-IRIS. Here, we aimed to investigate the relevance of
these markers in Schisto-IRIS.
METHODOLOGY: Patients were diagnosed with IRIS related to S. mansoni within a
cohort of patients with Schistosomiasis-HIV co-infection, using a clinical
working definition of Schisto-IRIS. We compared 9 patients who developed
Schisto-IRIS to 9 Schisto+HIV+ controls who did not, and 9 Schisto-HIV+ controls.
Plasma levels of MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-10, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, sCD14, intestinal
fatty-acid binding protein, C-reactive protein, and 8 anti-nuclear antibodies
(ANA) were analyzed prior to and during 3 months of ART.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Although no differences were observed for MMP-1 and -7,
MMP-10 levels decreased significantly in Schisto+HIV+ controls during 3 months of
ART (p = 0.005) while persisting in Schisto-IRIS patients at significantly higher
levels compared to Schisto-HIV+ controls (p≤0.030). In contrast TIMP-1 levels
only decreased significantly in Schisto-IRIS patients (p = 0.012), while TIMP-2
levels were lower compared to Schisto+HIV+ controls at 2 weeks (p = 0.007), 1
month (p = 0.005) and 3 months (p = 0.031) of ART. Five out of 8 ANAs studied
decreased significantly in Schisto-IRIS patients after 1 month of ART(p≤0.039),
whereas only 1 ANA decreased for Schisto+HIV+ controls (p = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we propose a working definition for the 
diagnosis of Schisto-IRIS in resource limited settings. We report persistent
plasma levels of MMP-10, along with a more pronounced decrease in TIMP-1 and
ANA-levels, and low levels of TIMP-2 during 3 months of ART. Corresponding to the
clinical symptoms, these data suggest that Schisto-IRIS is marked by unbalanced
MMP/TIMP dynamics which favor inflammation.

BACKGROUND: The atmosphere has become a major transport corridor for free
radicals and particulate matter from combustion events. The motivation behind
this study was to determine the nature of particulate emissions and surface bound
radicals formed during the thermal degradation of diesel blends in order to
assess the health and environmental hazards of binary transport fuels.
METHODOLOGY: Accordingly, this contribution explored the interactions that occur 
when Croton megalocarpus biodiesel and fossil diesel in the ratio of 1:1 by
weight were co-pyrolyzed in a quartz reactor at a residence time of 0.5 s under
an inert flow of nitrogen at 600 °C. The surface morphology of the thermal char
formed were imaged using a Feld emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG
SEM) while Electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (EPR) was used to explore
the presence of free radicals on the surface of thermal char. Molecular
functional groups adsorbed on the surface of thermal char were explored using
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
RESULTS: FTIR spectrum showed that the major functional groups on the surface of 
the char were basically aromatic and some methylene groups. The particulate
emissions detected in this work were ultrafine (~ 32 nm). The particulates are
consistent with the SEM images observed in this study. Electron paramagnetic
resonance results gave a g-value of 2.0027 characteristic of carbon-based
radicals of aromatic nature. Spectral peak-to-peak width (∆Hp-p) obtained was
narrow (4.42 G).
CONCLUSIONS: The free radicals identified as carbon-based are medically notorious
and may be transported by various sizes of particulate matter on to the surface
of the human lung which may trigger cancer and pulmonary diseases. The
nanoparticulates determined in this work can precipitate severe biological health
problems among humans and other natural ecosystems.

Many females lack access to water, privacy and basic sanitation-felt acutely when
menstruating. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) conditions in schools, such as
access to latrines, water, and soap, are essential for the comfort, equity, and
dignity of menstruating girls. Our study was nested within a cluster randomized
controlled pilot feasibility study where nurses provided menstrual items to
schoolgirls. We observed the WASH conditions of 30 schools from June 2012⁻October
2013 to see if there were any changes in conditions, to compare differences
between study arms and to examine agreement between observed and teacher-reported
conditions. Data came from study staff observed, and school head teacher
reported, WASH conditions. We developed scores for the condition of school
facilities to report any changes in conditions and compare outcomes across study 
arms. Results demonstrated that soap availability for students increased
significantly between baseline and follow-up while there was a significant
decrease in the number of "acceptable" latrines. During the study follow-up
period, individual WASH indicators supporting menstruating girls, such as locks
on latrine doors or water availability in latrines did not significantly improve.
Advances in WASH conditions for all students, and menstrual hygiene facilities
for schoolgirls, needs further support, a defined budget, and regular monitoring 
of WASH facilities to maintain standards.

This study investigated the effect of seven healing agents on crack healing
ability of long-term aged asphalt and its mortar. Different healing agents
including sunflower oil, aromatic oil, bitumen emulsion, and maltene-based
emulsions were used. The crack healing of asphalt made use of two asphalt disk
samples and healing was evaluated using direct tensile tests. For asphalt mortar,
notched semi-circular samples were used. Test results indicated that the crack
healing of asphalt and its mortar depended strongly on the type of healing agent.
In general, asphalt healed faster than its mortar. Asphalt healing could be well 
improved by using oil agents, while asphalt mortar could be well healed with
maltene-based emulsions. The crack healing of asphalt mortar developed rapidly
followed by a steady state of increase. Initial crack healing using healing
agents could be contributed by the diffusion and softening effects, which
resulted in low strength recovery. Long term healing could lead to the bonding
reconstitution in the cracks, which were decisive for the final strength gain.
The promising healing agent should be able to achieve maximum strength recovery
to resist cracking as well as a sufficient re-healing ability to deal with crack 
opening and closing.

High salt intake is a major risk factor of hypertension and cardiovascular
disease. Improving knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to salt
intake in the general population is a key component of salt reduction strategies.
The objective of this study was to describe and compare the KAP of adults related
to salt in urban areas of five countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The survey
included 588 participants aged 25 to 65 years who were selected using convenience
samples in the urban areas of Benin, Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, and Seychelles.
Socio-demographic and food consumption were assessed using a structured
closed-ended questionnaire administered by survey officers. Height, weight, and
blood pressure were measured. Food consumption varied largely between countries. 
Processed foods high in salt, such as processed meat, cheese, pizzas, and savory 
snacks were consumed rather infrequently in all the countries, but salt-rich
foods, such as soups or bread and salty condiments, were consumed frequently in
all countries. The majority of the participants knew that high salt intake can
cause health problems (85%) and thought that it is important to limit salt intake
(91%). However, slightly over half (56%) of the respondents regularly tried to
limit their salt intake while only 8% of the respondents thought that they
consumed too much salt. Salt and salty condiments were added most of the time
during cooking (92% and 64%, respectively) but rarely at the table (11%). These
findings support the need for education campaigns to reduce salt added during
cooking and for strategies to reduce salt content in selected manufactured foods 
in the region.

palliative and/or hospice care, pain and/or symptom management, patient advocacy,
public health, and health economics. Guideline development involved a systematic 
literature review, a modified ADAPTE process, and a formal consensus-based
process with the Expert Panel and additional experts (consensus ratings group).
Results The systematic review included 48 full-text publications regarding
palliative care in resource-constrained settings, along with cost-effectiveness
analyses; the evidence for many clinical questions was limited. These provided
indirect evidence to inform the formal consensus process, which resulted in
agreement of ≥ 75% (by consensus ratings group including Expert Panel).
Recommendations The recommendations help define the models of care, staffing
requirements, and roles and training needs of team members in a variety of
resource settings for palliative care. Recommendations also outline the standards
for provision of psychosocial support, spiritual care, and opioid analgesics,
which can be particularly challenging and often overlooked in
resource-constrained settings. Additional information is available at
www.asco.org/resource-stratified-guidelines . It is the view of ASCO that health 
care providers and health care system decision makers should be guided by the
recommendations for the highest stratum of resources available. The guideline is 
intended to complement but not replace local guidelines.

Diarrheal illness, a common occurrence among people living with HIV (PLHIV), is
largely preventable through access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and
hygiene (WASH) facilities. We examined WASH characteristics among households with
and without HIV-positive residents enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter
Study (GEMS) in rural Western Kenya. Using univariable logistic regression, we
examined differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative households in regard
to WASH practices. Among HIV-positive households, we explored the relationship
between the length of time knowing their HIV status and GEMS enrollment. No
statistically significant differences were apparent in the WASH characteristics
among HIV-positive and HIV-negative households. However, we found differences in 
the WASH characteristics among HIV-positive households who were aware of their
HIV status ≥ 30 days before enrollment compared with HIV-positive households who 
found out their status < 30 days before enrollment or thereafter. Significantly
more households aware of their HIV-positive status before enrollment reported
treating their drinking water (odds ratio [OR] confidence interval [CI]: 2.34
[1.12, 4.86]) and using effective water treatment methods (OR [CI]: 9.6 [3.09,
29.86]), and had better drinking water storage practices. This suggests that
within this region of Kenya, HIV programs are effective in promoting the
importance of practicing positive WASH-related behaviors among PLHIV.

Foraging parasitoids use chemical signals in host recognition and selection
processes. Although, the volatiles play a relevant role in the localization by
parasitoids of their hosts feeding on plants, the host identification process for
acceptance occurs mainly during contact between the parasitoid and its host where
host products related to feeding activities, fecal pellets and oral secretions,
play a crucial role. The purpose of this study was to identify the nature of the 
contact kairomone(s) that mediate the acceptance for oviposition of the
parasitoid Cotesia flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), which was released
in Kenya in 1993 to control the invasive crambid Chilo partellus (Swinhoe). Using
host and non-hosts of C. flavipes, we showed that it is mainly the oral
secretions of the larvae that harbour the active compound(s) that mediate host
acceptance for oviposition by C. flavipes. Using an integration of behavioral
observations and biochemical approaches, the active compound of the oral
secretions was identified as an α-amylase. Using synthetized α-amylases from
Drosophila melanogaster (an insect model for which syntheses of active and
inactive α-amylases are available), we observed that the conformation of the
enzyme rather than its catalytic site as well as its substrate and its
degradation product is responsible for host acceptance and oviposition mediation 
of C. flavipes females. The results suggest that the α-amylase from oral
secretions of the caterpillar host is a good candidate for an evolutionary
solution to host acceptance for oviposition in C. flavipes.

Information sharing is an important pillar for any strategy that aims to control 
infectious diseases especially in farms and systems that are connected. A study
was designed to analyze practices related to sharing of animal health information
and identify health constraints affecting livestock keeping in smallholder
farming systems of Mwala in Machakos County. Data were collected through focus
group discussions (number of groups = 3) and one-on-one questionnaire interviews 
(n = 172). These were analyzed using both descriptive and thematic approaches.
The most (33%; n = 158) feared animal disease was pneumonia which was also the
most (62%) frequently reported health problem. Rabies, Newcastle disease, and
east coast fever were ranked high by the farmer groups. Current animal management
practices, for example, failure to confine dogs, predispose the community to a
number of health risks including bites from rabid animals. Smallholder farmers in
Mwala utilize a number of options to communicate animal health problems; such
sharing is, however, constrained by a number of factors including bad roads, poor
coverage of mobile networks, and bad relationships between animal health
providers and the farmers themselves. Some of the reasons why farmers delay the
reporting of disease problems included the tendency for one to first try local
herbal formulations, the bad times when cases are observed, and the
unavailability of reliable animal health providers at the time when the farmers
need them. This study has provided useful baseline data that can then be used to 
(1) design a village-based animal disease reporting system which is currently
lacking in the surveyed villages and (2) support the county government's efforts 
to manage animal diseases including zoonoses, through better reporting, for
improved health, nutrition, and livelihoods.

Background: High sea surface temperatures resulted in widespread coral bleaching 
and mortality in Mayotte Island (northern Mozambique channel, Indian Ocean:
12.1°S, 45.1°E) in April-June 2010.
Methods: Twenty three representative coral genera were sampled quantitatively for
size class distributions during the peak of the bleaching event to measure its
impact.
Results: Fifty two percent of coral area was impacted, comprising 19.3% pale,
10.7% bleached, 4.8% partially dead and 17.5% recently dead. Acropora, the
dominant genus, was the second most susceptible to bleaching (22%, pale and
bleached) and mortality (32%, partially dead and dead), only exceeded by
Pocillopora (32% and 47%, respectively). The majority of genera showed
intermediate responses, and the least response was shown by Acanthastrea and
Leptastrea (6% pale and bleached). A linear increase in bleaching susceptibility 
was found from small colonies (<2.5 cm, 83% unaffected) to large ones (>80 cm,
33% unaffected), across all genera surveyed. Maximum mortality in 2010 was
estimated at 32% of coral area or biomass, compared to half that (16%), by colony
abundance.
Discussion: Mayotte reefs have displayed a high level of resilience to bleaching 
events in 1983, 1998 and the 2010 event reported here, and experienced a further 
bleaching event in 2016. However, prospects for continued resilience are
uncertain as multiple threats are increasing: the rate of warming experienced
(0.1 °C per decade) is some two to three times less than projected warming in
coming decades, the interval between severe bleaching events has declined from 16
to 6 years, and evidence of chronic mortality from local human impacts is
increasing. The study produced four recommendations for reducing bias when
monitoring and assessing coral bleaching: coral colony size should be measured,
unaffected colonies should be included in counts, quadrats or belt transects
should be used and weighting coefficients in the calculation of indices should be
used with caution.

Background: Quail egg (QE) has been reported to possess an anti-allergic and
anti-inflammatory activity. We have demonstrated that whole QE was able to
attenuate the allergic symptoms in food allergy-induced EoE murine model, but
whether QE albumen or QE yolk plays a more important role still remains unclear.
Objective: In this current study, we investigated the suppressive role of QE in
mast cell degranulation and cytokine production of the effect phase response.
Method: A passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) mouse model was used to confirm the
anti-allergic effect of QE. Besides, HMC-1 cell model was used to study its
suppressive role in more detail. In this in vitro study, we divided QE into three
groups: whole QE, QE albumen, and QE yolk. The effect of QE treatment on mast
cell degranulation and intracellular calcium influx was investigated. Moreover,
the effect of QE allergy- related mediators, genes, and proteins were also
assessed by ELISA, RT-PCR, and western blotting.
Results and discussion: Our data showed that the extent of mast cell
degranulation-mediated ear vascular permeability in IgE-mediated PCA mice treated
with whole QE (17 mg/kg) was decreased significantly up to 43.31 ± 0.42%
reduction. HMC-1 cell-based immunological assay in vitro indicated that QE,
particularly its albumen, acted as a 'mast cell stabilizer'. Under the
concentration of 70 μg/mL, QE albumen effectively suppressed the releases of
β-hexosaminidase, histamine, and tryptase, as well as Th2 and pro-inflammatory
cytokine production; reached 30 up to 50% reduction. Besides, QE albumen was also
able to significantly modulate the upregulation of IL-10 up to 58.30 ± 5.9%.
Interestingly, our data indicated that QE yolk still had a significant inhibitory
effect on modulating Th2 cytokines in its highest concentration (100 μg/mL),
while QE albumen showed no inhibitory effect. Western blot analysis showed QE
albumen effectively down-regulated the expressions of calcium-related protein
(TRPC1, Orai1, STIM1, PLC-γ and IP3R), facilitated the reduction of PAR-2 and
induced the reduction of phosphorylation of JNK, IKKα, p50 and p65 protein
expressions.
Conclusion: As confirmed by PCA and HMC-1 cell-based immunology assay, QE albumen
and QE yolk may work together through exerting anti-allergy activity and can be
used as a potential anti-allergic nutrient in the future.

Emergency Department, The Aga Khan University, Nairobi, Kenya.

BACKGROUND: A novel point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) training program was
developed to train rural healthcare providers in Kenya on the Focused Assessment 
with Sonography for Trauma (FAST), thoracic ultrasound, basic echocardiography,
and focused obstetric ultrasonography. The program includes a multimedia manual, 
pre-course testing, 1-day hands-on training, post-testing, 3-month post-course
evaluation, and scheduled refresher training. This study evaluates the impact of 
the course on PoCUS knowledge and skills. Competency results were compared based 
on number of previous training/refresher sessions and time elapsed since prior
training.
METHODS: Trainees were evaluated using a computer-based, 30 question,
multiple-choice test, a standardized observed structured clinical exam (OSCE),
and a survey on their ultrasound use over the previous 3 months.
RESULTS: Thirty-three trainees were evaluated at 21 different facilities. All
trainees completed the written exam, and 32 completed the OSCE. Nine trainees out
of 33 (27.3%) passed the written test. Trainees with two or more prior training
sessions had statistically significant increases in their written test scores,
while those with only one prior training session maintained their test scores.
Time elapsed since last training was not associated with statistically
significant differences in mean written test scores. Mean image quality scores
(95% confidence interval) were 2.65 (2.37-2.93) for FAST, 2.41 (2.03-2.78) for
thoracic, 2.22 (1.89-2.55) for cardiac, and 2.95 (2.67-3.24) for obstetric exams.
There was a trend towards increased mean image quality scores with increases in
the number of prior training sessions, and a trend towards decreased image
quality with increased time elapsed since previous training. Forty percent of
trainees reported performing more than 20 scans in the previous 3 months, while
22% reported less than 10 scans in the previous 3 months. Second and third
trimester focused obstetric ultrasound was the most frequently performed scan
type. Frequency of scanning was positively correlated with written test scores
and image quality scores.
CONCLUSION: This novel training program has the potential to improve PoCUS
knowledge and skills amongst rural healthcare providers in Kenya. There is an
ongoing need to increase refresher/re-training opportunities and to enhance
frequency of scanning in order to improve PoCUS competency.

Understanding variations in health insurance coverage in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria,
and Tanzania: Evidence from demographic and health surveys.

Ghana.

BACKGROUND: Realisation of universal health coverage is not possible without
health financing systems that ensure financial risk protection. To ensure this,
some African countries have instituted health insurance schemes as venues for
ensuring universal access to health care for their populace. In this paper, we
examined variations in health insurance coverage in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and
Tanzania.
METHODS: We used data from demographic and health surveys of Ghana (2014), Kenya 
(2014), Nigeria (2013), and Tanzania (2015). Women aged 15-49 and men aged 15-59 
years were included in the study. Our study population comprised 9,378 women and 
4,371 men from Ghana, 14,656 women and 12,712 men from Kenya, 38,598 women and
17,185 men from Nigeria, and 10,123 women and 2,514 men from Tanzania. Bivariate 
and multivariate techniques were used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: Coverage was highest in Ghana (Females = 62.4%, Males = 49.1%) and
lowest in Nigeria (Females = 1.1%, Males = 3.1%). Age, level of education,
residence, wealth status, and occupation were the socio-economic factors
influencing variations in health insurance coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: There are variations in health insurance coverage in Ghana, Kenya,
Nigeria, and Tanzania, with Ghana recording the highest coverage. Kenya,
Tanzania, and Nigeria may not be able to achieve universal health coverage and
meet the sustainable development goals on health by the year 2030 if the current 
fragmented public health insurance systems persist in those countries. Therefore,
the various schemes of these countries should be harmonised to help maximise the 
size of their risk pools and increase the confidence of potential subscribers in 
the systems, which may encourage them to enrol.

The present study aimed at identifying and assessing antimicrobial resistance of 
Enterococcus spp. isolated from small and medium enterprise slaughterhouses in
Kenya. In total, 67 isolates were recovered from 48 of 195 samples examined from 
beef carcasses, personnel, and cutting equipment in five small and medium
enterprise slaughterhouses. The isolates were identified by using matrix-assisted
laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and screened
thereafter for their resistance against 12 antibiotics by using a disk diffusion 
assay. The isolates ( n = 67) included Enterococcus faecalis (41.8%),
Enterococcus mundtii (17.9%), Enterococcus thailandicus (13.4%), Enterococcus
faecium (9.0%), Enterococcus hirae (7.5%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (6.0%), and
Enterococcus devriesei (4.5%). None of the isolates were resistant to
ciprofloxacin, penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, nitrofurantoin, teicoplanin,
linezolid, and levofloxacin. Resistance to rifampin (46.3%), erythromycin
(23.9%), tetracycline (20.9%), and chloramphenicol (7.5%) was distributed among
six of the seven species. All E. thailandicus were resistant to rifampin,
erythromycin, and tetracycline. E. faecalis was resistant to rifampin (60.7%),
tetracycline (17.9%), erythromycin (14.3%), and chloramphenicol (10.7%).
Resistance to two or three antibiotics was observed in 26.9% of the enterococci
isolates. The isolation of enterococci that are resistant to clinically relevant 
antibiotics, such as erythromycin, is of a serious concern given the role
enterococci play in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes.

BACKGROUND: The Transform Nutrition ( Transform) research consortium (2012-2017),
led by the International Food Policy Research Institute, sought to generate
evidence to inform and inspire action to address undernutrition in 4 high-burden 
countries (India, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Ethiopia) and globally.
OBJECTIVE: Within the context of the literature, this synthesis article brings
together core findings of Transform, highlighting priorities for future research.
METHODS: This article uses a narrative approach to synthesize diverse study
findings that collectively address Transform's three primary research questions: 
(1) How can nutrition-specific interventions be appropriately designed,
implemented, scaled, and sustained in different settings?; (2) How can the
nutritional impact of social protection and agriculture be improved?; and (3) How
can enabling environments be promoted so as to use existing political and
economic resources more effectively?
RESULTS: Highlights of Transform include (1) improved understanding of the
relative effectiveness of different combinations of nutrition-specific
interventions and the ways in which they can be scaled for maximal impact; (2)
evidence that shows that social protection and agriculture need to be explicitly 
linked to nutrition in order to contribute to stunting reduction; (3)
identification of key components of "enabling environments" for nutrition and how
they can be cultivated/sustained; (4) research that examines ways in which
leaders emerge and operate to change the political and policy landscape in
different settings; and (5) "stories of change" that provide in-depth contextual 
knowledge of how transformative change has been driven in countries that have
made inroads in reducing malnutrition. The conclusion highlights the
contributions of the consortium and provides recommendations for future research.

RATIONALE: The burden of critical care is greatest in resource-limited settings
(RLS). Intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes at public hospitals in Kenya are
unknown. This study is timely given the Ministry of Health initiative to expand
ICU capacity.
OBJECTIVES: Identify factors associated with mortality at Moi Teaching and
Referral Hospital; validate the Mortality Probability Admission Model-II0
(MPM-II0).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 450 patients from January 1, 2013 to April 5, 
2015 was evaluated using demographics, presenting diagnoses, interventions,
mortality, and cost data.
RESULTS: ICU mortality was 53.6% and 30-day mortality was 57.3%. Most patients
were male (61%), ≥18 years old (70%) with median age of 29 years. Factors
associated with high adjusted odds of mortality: Age <10 (aOR: 3.59 p≤0.001);
35-49 (aOR: 3.13, p=0.002); >50 (aOR: 2.86, p=0.004), reference:10-24 years,
sepsis (aOR: 3.39, p=0.01), acute stroke (aOR: 8.14 p=0.011), acute respiratory
failure or mechanical ventilation (aOR: 6.37, p<0.001), and vasopressor support
(aOR: 7.98, p<0.001). Drug/alcohol poisoning (aOR: 0.33, p=0.005) was associated 
with lower adjusted odds of mortality. MPM-II0 discrimination shows area under
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72 - 0.82);
Hosmer-Lemeshow test for calibration was significant (p-value < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In a public Kenyan ICU, high mortality was noted despite the use of 
advanced therapies. MPM-II0 has acceptable discrimination but poor calibration.
Modification of MPM-II0 or development of a new model using a prospective
multicenter global collaboration is needed. Standardized triage and treatment
protocols for high risk diagnoses are needed to improve ICU outcomes.

Women of child-bearing age (especially pregnant and lactating women) are in the
most nutritionally-vulnerable stages of the life cycle. The aim of this study was
to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of good nutrition among women of
childbearing age in Somolu Local Government (LG), Lagos state. This study was a
crosssectional descriptive survey of 244 women of childbearing age (15-49 years).
Excellent knowledge and good attitude towards good nutrition was observed among
61.89% and 86.89% respectively. During pregnancy, greater than 80% took folic
acid, iron supplements and increased daily consumption of fruits and vegetables
while 43.59% avoided eggs, fish, meat and chocolate beverage because of taboos.
Seven days prior to interview, over 90% had consumed fast foods, 56.15% and
50.01% of the respondents ate fruits and vegetables every day to ≥4 times in a
day respectively. A majority of the respondents knew and had a good attitude
towards good nutrition supporting studies from Kenya and Northern Nigeria. This, 
however, did not translate to good practice for about half of the respondents.

Cost-effective high-density (HD) genotypes of livestock species can be obtained
by genotyping a proportion of the population using a HD panel and the remainder
using a cheaper low-density panel, and then imputing the missing genotypes that
are not directly assayed in the low-density panel. The efficacy of genotype
imputation can largely be affected by the structure and history of the specific
target population and it should be checked before incorporating imputation in
routine genotyping practices. Here, we investigated the efficacy of imputation in
crossbred dairy cattle populations of East Africa using 4 different commercial
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) panels, 3 reference populations, and 3
imputation algorithms. We found that Minimac and a reference population, which
included a mixture of crossbred and ancestral purebred animals, provided the
highest imputation accuracy compared with other scenarios of imputation. The
accuracies of imputation, measured as the correlation between real and imputed
genotypes averaged across SNP, were around 0.76 and 0.94 for 7K and 40K SNP,
respectively, when imputed up to a 770K panel. We also presented a method to
maximize the imputation accuracy of low-density panels, which relies on the
pairwise (co)variances between SNP and the minor allele frequency of SNP. The
performance of the developed method was tested in a 5-fold cross-validation
process where various densities of SNP were selected using the (co)variance
method and also by alternative SNP selection methods and then imputed up to the
HD panel. The (co)variance method provided the highest imputation accuracies at
almost all marker densities, with accuracies being up to 0.19 higher than the
random selection of SNP. The accuracies of imputation from 7K and 40K panels
selected using the (co)variance method were around 0.80 and 0.94, respectively.
The presented method also achieved higher accuracy of genomic prediction at lower
densities of selected SNP. The squared correlation between genomic breeding
values estimated using imputed genotypes and those from the real 770K HD panel
was 0.95 when the accuracy of imputation was 0.64. The presented method for SNP
selection is straightforward in its application and can ensure high accuracies in
genotype imputation of crossbred dairy populations in East Africa.

OBJECTIVE: Integration of services is a promising way to improve access to
contraception in sub-Saharan Africa, but few studies have evaluated this strategy
to increase access to contraception among women requiring anticoagulation. Our
objective was to evaluate a model of care integrating contraceptive counseling
and provision within an anticoagulation management clinic in Eldoret, Kenya, to
determine the impact on long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) use.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a prospective observational study of reproductive-age 
women referred for integrated services from the anticoagulation management clinic
at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital from March 2015 to March 2016. All
participants received disease-specific contraceptive counseling and provision,
free reversible methods (excluding hormonal intrauterine devices [IUDs]) and
follow-up care. We compared LARC use 3 months postintervention to preintervention
using the proportions test. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine
factors related to use of contraceptive implants and copper IUDs.
RESULTS: Of 190 participants, 171 (90%) completed 3-month follow-up. There was a 
significant increase in contraceptive implant use from 10% to 19%, p=.02, and
injectable contraceptive use from 14% to 24%, p=.013. There was a concomitant
decrease in the use of no method/abstinence from 57% to 39% (33% decrease,
p<.001). Younger age, having at least one child and discussing family planning
with a partner were predictive of LARC use.
CONCLUSION: Integrating contraceptive services into an anticoagulation management
clinic increases the use of highly effective contraception for women with
cardiovascular disease. Implementation of similar models of care should be
evaluated within other sites for chronic disease management.
IMPLICATIONS: A model of care integrating contraceptive counseling and provision 
into anticoagulation management services is an effective strategy to improve LARC
and overall highly effective contraceptive use among women with cardiovascular
disease requiring anticoagulation. This model of care may be utilized to prevent 
maternal morbidity and mortality among this high-risk population.

Challenges toward achieving universal health coverage in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria,
and Tanzania.

Umeh CA(1).

Author information:

Although many sub-Saharan African countries have made efforts to provide
universal health coverage (UHC) for their citizens, several of these initiatives 
have achieved little success. This study aims to review the challenges facing UHC
in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania, and to suggest program or policy changes 
that might bolster UHC. Routine data reported by the World Bank and World Health 
Organization, as well as annual reports of the national health insurance schemes 
of Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania, were analyzed. The data were supplemented
by a review of published and gray literature on health insurance coverage in
these four countries. The analysis showed that some of the challenges facing UHC 
in these countries include (1) large proportion of the population living in
extreme poverty and unable to pay premiums, (2) large informal sector whose
members are mostly uninsured, (3) high dropout rate from insurance schemes, (4)
poorly funded primary health care system, and (5) segmented health insurance fund
pool. In order to achieve UHC by 2030, it will be important for these countries
to (1) raise sufficient revenue to finance their health systems, (2) improve the 
efficiency of revenue utilization, (3) identify and provide coverage for the very
poor, (4) reduce the proportion of the population that is underinsured, and (5)
improve access to quality health care in rural areas.

BACKGROUND: Purchasing in health care financing refers to the transfer of pooled 
funds to health care providers for the provision of health care services. There
is limited empirical work on purchasing arrangements and what is required for
strategic purchasing in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted this study
to critically assess the purchasing arrangements of the county departments of
health (CDOH) who are the largest purchasers of health care in Kenya.
METHODS: We used a qualitative case study approach to assess the extent to which 
the purchasing actions of the CDOH in Kenya were strategic. We purposively
sampled 10 counties and collected data using in-depth interviews (n = 81), focus 
group discussions (n = 4), and documents review. We analyzed data using a
framework approach.
RESULTS: County departments of health did not practice strategic purchasing. The 
government's (national and county) role as a steward for the purchasing function 
was characterized by poor accountability and inadequate budgetary allocations for
service delivery. The absence of a purchaser-provider split between the CDOH and 
public health care providers undermined provider selection based on performance
and quality. Poor public participation and ineffective complaints and feedback
mechanisms limited public accountability and responsiveness to the needs of the
people.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that while there are frameworks that could promote 
strategic purchasing of the CDOH, strategic purchasing is impaired by poor
implementation of these frameworks and the inherent weaknesses of a public
integrated purchasing system that lacks purchaser-provider split.

East Africa is undergoing rapid expansion of pig rearing, driven by increasing
pork consumption. Introduction and expansion of pig production systems in this
biodiverse landscape may create new risks, including zoonotic pathogen
transmission. Historically, biosecurity measures have primarily been focused at
farm level, ignoring the important function pig traders fulfill between farmers
and consumers. This study interviewed pig traders operating at Uganda's only
registered pork abattoir to describe their characteristics, business practices,
biosecurity practices, and pig health management and reporting practices. All the
traders were male, and nearly all (90.5%) relied on pig trading as their primary 
source of income. Most of the pigs brought for processing at the slaughterhouse
were purchased from smallholder farms (87.3%). In addition, there was a
significant difference in the high price paid per kilogram at farm gate by region
(P = 0.005). High prices paid at farm gate were associated with holiday periods
(P < 0.001), harvest season (P < 0.001), and drought (P < 0.001). Traders
preferred buying live pigs from male farmers (88.9%) because they were considered
the final decision makers and owned the pigs being sold. All pig traders were
aware of clinical signs indicating a pig was sick. This study has provided
baseline information on pig trader practices in Uganda. Improvements in local
pork slaughterhouses and markets will benefit not only pig traders in accessing
consistent customers but also individual pig farmers by increasing their market
access. Finally, given their role as a link between farmers and consumers,
traders would benefit from targeted inclusion in disease control and prevention
strategies.

PURPOSE: We performed a systematic review of the ethical, social, and cultural
issues associated with delivery of genetic services in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs).
METHODS: We searched 11 databases for studies addressing ethical, social, and/or 
cultural issues associated with clinical genetic testing and/or counselling
performed in LMICs. Narrative synthesis was employed to analyze findings, and
resultant themes were mapped onto the social ecological model (PROSPERO
#CRD42016042894).
RESULTS: After reviewing 13,308 articles, 192 met inclusion criteria. Nine themes
emerged: (1) genetic counseling has a tendency of being directive, (2) genetic
services have psychosocial consequences that require improved support, (3)
medical genetics training is inadequate, (4) genetic services are difficult to
access, (5) social determinants affect uptake and understanding of genetic
services, (6) social stigma is often associated with genetic disease, (7) family 
values are at risk of disruption by genetic services, (8) religious principles
pose barriers to acceptability and utilization of genetic services, and (9)
cultural beliefs and practices influence uptake of information and understanding 
of genetic disease.
CONCLUSION: We identified a number of complex and interrelated ethical, cultural,
and social issues with implications implications for further development of
genetic services in LMICs.

The idea that noncrop habitat enhances pest control and represents a win-win
opportunity to conserve biodiversity and bolster yields has emerged as an
agroecological paradigm. However, while noncrop habitat in landscapes surrounding
farms sometimes benefits pest predators, natural enemy responses remain
heterogeneous across studies and effects on pests are inconclusive. The observed 
heterogeneity in species responses to noncrop habitat may be biological in origin
or could result from variation in how habitat and biocontrol are measured. Here, 
we use a pest-control database encompassing 132 studies and 6,759 sites worldwide
to model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation rates, and crop damage as a
function of landscape composition. Our results showed that although landscape
composition explained significant variation within studies, pest and enemy
abundances, predation rates, crop damage, and yields each exhibited different
responses across studies, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing in
landscapes with more noncrop habitat but overall showing no consistent trend.
Thus, models that used landscape-composition variables to predict pest-control
dynamics demonstrated little potential to explain variation across studies,
though prediction did improve when comparing studies with similar crop and
landscape features. Overall, our work shows that surrounding noncrop habitat does
not consistently improve pest management, meaning habitat conservation may
bolster production in some systems and depress yields in others. Future efforts
to develop tools that inform farmers when habitat conservation truly represents a
win-win would benefit from increased understanding of how landscape effects are
modulated by local farm management and the biology of pests and their enemies.

The Net Promoter Score (NPS) for Insight Into Client Experiences in Sexual and
Reproductive Health Clinics.

The Net Promoter Score (NPS) metric, commonly used by Fortune 500 companies to
measure the customer experience, is calculated using a 0-to-10 scale to answer 1 
question: "How likely is it that you would recommend [company X] to a friend or
colleague?" Despite the value of this methodology as a predictor of growth and
indicator of customer satisfaction in for-profit industries, uptake of the NPS
has been slower in the social sector due to concerns about its applicability and 
acceptability in noncommercial settings, particularly among low-literacy
populations. To address these concerns, we conducted a series of small-scale
pilots in El Salvador, India, Kenya, and Nigeria to test different implementation
approaches of the NPS in sexual and reproductive health clinics-including
face-to-face interviews, a guided drop box, integration of the NPS question into 
an existing client exit interview, and self-administered and volunteer-assisted
online surveys using tablets in clinics-and compared the traditional 0-to-10
number scale with an emoji-face scale. Findings showed that the NPS can be
effectively adapted for use in low-resource health clinics among low-literacy
clients using the number scale. There was no statistically significant difference
in mean likeliness to recommend services when using the emoji versus numerical
scales in India; however, there was a statistically significant difference when
using the guided drop box approach versus face-to-face interviews. When combined 
with demographic and service-use questions, the NPS generated useful insights on 
client groups that were more or less likely to recommend the services. While
providing an online survey on tablets can be an efficient methodology for
implementing the NPS, self-administered approaches may be limited by a client's
level of literacy or comfort with technology. For those client populations with a
lower NPS, we advise using a qualitative feedback process that can elicit
critical feedback to identify actions to improve their experience. Our experience
with testing and implementing the NPS in SRH clinics in diverse settings suggests
it is a promising approach to gaining insight into the client experience in
nonprofit health care settings.

We assessed prevalence and correlates of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) including herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2),
gonorrhoea (GC), syphilis (SYP), Chlamydia (CT) and HIV among Kenyan women aged
18-34 years who were screened for a contraceptive intravaginal ring study. Women 
provided demographic, behavioural and medical information, and underwent medical 
evaluation, including a pelvic exam. We computed crude and adjusted prevalence
ratio (aPR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using log-binomial regression. Of
463 women screened, 457 provided laboratory specimens and were included in the
analysis. The median age was 25 years, interquartile range (21-28), and 68.5% had
completed primary or lower education. Overall, 72.2% tested positive for any STI 
or BV. Point prevalence was 55.6, 38.5, 3.9, 2.0, 4.6, and 14.7% for HSV-2, BV,
GC, SYP, CT, and HIV, respectively. Co-infection with HSV-2, BV, and HIV occurred
in 28 (6.1%) participants. Having ≥1 STI/BV was associated with younger age at
first sex (≤13 versus 17-19 years, aPR=1.27, 95% CI 1.07-1.51), history of
exchange sex (aPR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.07-3.92), sexual intercourse in the past seven
days (aPR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.36), and older age (30-34 versus 18-24 years,
aPR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.48). STI/BV diagnosis was less likely for women
reporting one lifetime sexual partner compared to women with ≥4 lifetime sexual
partners (aPR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.92). Combination prevention approaches
(biomedical, behavioural, social, and structural) tailored to women with diverse 
risk profiles may help mitigate STI/BV prevalence in this setting.

In an internet-based, forced-choice, test of the 'face race lightness illusion', 
the majority of respondents, regardless of their ethnicity, reported perceiving
the African face as darker in skin tone than the European face, despite the mean 
luminance, contrast and numbers of pixels of the images were identical. In the
laboratory, using eye tracking, it was found that eye fixations were distributed 
differently on the African face and European face, so that gaze dwelled
relatively longer onto the locally brighter regions of the African face and, in
turn, mean pupil diameters were smaller than for the European face. There was no 
relationship between pupils' size and implicit social attitude (IAT) scores. In
another experiment, the faces were presented either tachistoscopically (140 ms)
or longer (2500 ms) so that, when gaze was prevented from looking directly at the
faces in the former condition, the tendency to report the African face as "dark" 
disappeared, but it was present when gaze was free to move for just a few
seconds. We conclude that the presence of the illusion depends on oculomotor
behavior and we also propose a novel account based on a predictive strategy of
sensory acquisition. Specifically, by differentially directing gaze towards to
facial regions that are locally different in luminance, the resulting changes in 
retinal illuminance yield respectively darker or brighter percepts while
attending to each face, hence minimizing the mismatch between visual input and
the learned perceptual prototypes of ethnic categories.

BACKGROUND: Home-based records (HBRs), which take many forms, serve as an
important tool for frontline health workers by providing a standardized patient
history vital to making informed decisions about the need for immunization
services. There are increasing concerns around HBRs with recording areas that are
functionally irrelevant because records are incomplete or not up-to-date. The aim
of this report was to describe HBR ownership and report on the utilization of
selected recording areas in HBRs across selected study communities in Kenya.
METHODS: The Kenya Missed Opportunities for Vaccination Assessment utilized a
mixed-methods approach that included exit interviews, using a standardized
questionnaire, among a convenience sample of caregivers of children aged <24
months attending a health facility during November 2016 as well as interviews of 
health staff and facility administrators. In addition to the exit interview data,
we analysed data obtained from a review of available HBRs from the children.
RESULTS: A total of 677 children were identified with a valid date of birth and
who were aged <24 months. A HBR was in hand and reviewed for three-quarters of
the children. Nearly one-third (n = 41) of those without a HBR in hand at the
visit noted that they did not know the importance of bringing the document with
them. Roughly two-thirds (n = 443) of caregivers noted they were asked by clinic 
staff to see the HBR during the clinic visit. Across the 516 reviewed HBRs,
recording areas were most commonly identified for the child's demographic
information (80% of HBRs) and vaccination history (82%) with information marked
in >90% of records. Recording areas were less frequently available for child
early eye / vision problems (61%), growth monitoring (74%) and vitamin A (76%);
with information marked in 33%, 88% and 60% of records, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Critical to the reduction of missed opportunities for vaccination,
the HBR's importance must be emphasized and the document must be requested by
health workers at every health encounter. Health workers must not only ensure
that all children receive a HBR and counsel caregivers of its importance, but
they must also ensure that all sections of the record are legibly completed to
ensure continuity of care. Programmes are encouraged to periodically review and
critically assess the HBR to determine whether the document's design and content 
areas are optimal to end user needs.

Development of a Person-Centered Family Planning Scale in India and Kenya.

Sudhinaraset M, Afulani PA, Diamond-Smith N, Golub G, Srivastava A.

Despite recognition that person-centered care is a critical component to
providing high quality family planning services, there lacks consensus on how to 
operationalize and measure it. This paper describes the development and
validation of a person-centered family planning (PCFP) scale in India and Kenya. 
Cross-sectional data were collected from 522 women in Kenya and 225 women in
India who visited a health facility providing family planning services.
Psychometric analyses, including exploratory factor analysis, were employed to
assess the validity and reliability of the PCFP scale. Separate scales were
developed for India and Kenya due to context-specific items. We assessed
criterion validity by examining the association between PCFP and global measures 
of quality and satisfaction with family planning care. The analysis resulted in a
multidimensional PCFP scale, including 20 items in Kenya and 22 items in India.
Through iterative factor analysis, two subscales were identified for both
countries: "autonomy, respectful care, and communication" and "health facility
environment." This scale may be used to evaluate quality improvement
interventions and experiences of women globally to support women in achieving
their reproductive health goals.

Background: Children who experience sexual abuse undergo various negative
psychosocial outcomes such as depressive symptoms. Unfortunately, not many
studies have been conducted on the incidence of depressive symptoms among
sexually abused children in Kenya. This study sought to ascertain the incidence
of depressive symptoms among children who have experienced sexual abuse in Kenya.
Methods: This was a longitudinal study design. It was conducted at Kenyatta
National Teaching and Referral Hospital and Nairobi Women's Hospitals in Kenya.
One hundred and ninety-one children who had experienced sexual abuse and their
parents/legal guardians were invited to participate in the study. The study
administered the Becks Depression Inventory and the Child Depression Inventory to
the children.
Results: The incidence of depressive symptoms after 1 month of sexual abuse
revealed that amongst children who were below 16 years old, 14.6% had
minimal-mild depressive symptoms while 85.4% had moderate-severe depressive
symptoms. In comparison, children who were 16 years or older, 6.4% had
minimal-mild depressive symptoms while 93.6% had moderate-severe depressive
symptoms. Children below 16 years old whose parents were separated were found to 
have depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) as well as those who were presented early
for medical care (p < 0.004), while children aged 16 years and above who were
abused by strangers were more likely to have depressive symptoms (p < 0.024) and 
those who were not attending school (p < 0.002).
Conclusion: Sexual abuse of children is world-wide and the Kenyan situation is
comparable. Being the victim of sexual abuse as a child has major psychological
and emotional sequlae which need to be addressed in Kenya. Children who
experience sexual abuse have very high incidence of developing depressive
symptoms. All the sexually abused children studied suffered from depressive
symptoms and a large majority suffered from major depressive symptoms that should
be promptly and effectively addressed to ameliorate psychological suffering among
children.

Background: Astrocytomas are primary central nervous system tumors arising from
astrocytes and accounting for up to 37.8% of all brain tumors seen in
hospital-based studies from Africa. Despite being common, their patterns and
short-term outcomes remain poorly studied in Kenya.
Materials and Methods: A prospective, descriptive study involving consecutive
patients with a histological diagnosis of astrocytoma seen in three hospitals
located in Eldoret, Kenya. Clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes were
recorded and patients followed up for 12 weeks.
Results: Thirty-one patients were recruited over a 1-year period. Majority of
them were female (51.6%). Headache (83.9%) and focal neurological deficits
(64.5%) were the most common presenting features. Among patients with high-grade 
tumors, mean duration of illness was 106.03 ± 162.16 days, median functional
status was Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score 50, mean tumor size was
110.22 ± 46.16 cm3, and median magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) score was 17.
Among patients with low-grade astrocytomas, mean duration of illness was 213.03 ±
344.93 days, median functional status was KPS score 40, mean tumor size was 53.49
± 54.96 cm3 and median MRI score was 9. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (71%) and
diffuse astrocytoma (22.6%) were the predominant histological subtypes. The
median Ki-67 proliferative index was 6% for pilocytic astrocytoma, 1.6% for
diffuse astrocytoma, and 60% for GBM. Systemic and regional surgical
complications occurred in 6.5% and 38.7% of patients, respectively. In-hospital
mortality was 19.4% and increased to 25.8% at 12 weeks. The KPS score at
discharge was 50 and improved to 60 at 12 weeks. Only 9.7% of patients had
acceptable functional status at 12 weeks follow-up.
Conclusions: In this locality, headache, focal neurological deficits, and reduced
functional status are the most common presenting features of astrocytomas while
GBM is the most common histological subtype. Tumors are highly proliferative and 
in the short-term, both surgical and functional outcome are suboptimal.

There has been an increasing interest in fodder trees and their potential to help
the rural poor. However, few studies have addressed the ecological impacts of
fodder tree harvesting. We investigated the species harvested and the techniques 
used, and the effects of fodder harvesting on (1) species' populations and (2)
forest carbon stocks in three montane forests in Kenya. Focus-group discussions
were organized in 36 villages to determine which species were harvested and with 
which techniques. Field observations were made on vegetation plots: stem
diameter, tree height, species and extent of harvest were recorded. Carbon stocks
were calculated using an allometric equation with (1) observed height of
harvested trees, and (2) potential height estimated with a power model, and
results were compared. Eight tree species were commonly harvested for fodder
using different techniques (some branches, main stem, most branches except stem
apex). Fodder harvesting (together with other uses for some species) negatively
affected one species populations (Olea europaea), it did not negatively affect
four (Drypetes gerrardii, Gymnosporia heterophylla, Pavetta gardeniifolia,
Xymalos monospora), and more information is needed for three species (Olea
capensis, Prunus africana, Rinorea convallarioides). Fodder harvesting did not
significantly reduce forest carbon stocks, suggesting that local communities
could continue using these fodder trees if a carbon project is established. Among
the fodder species studied, X. monospora could be used in reforestation programs,
as it has multiple uses and can withstand severe pruning. Although our study is
only a snapshot, it is a baseline which can be used to monitor changes in fodder 
harvesting and its impacts related to increasing droughts in northern Kenya and
increasing human populations.

BACKGROUND: There is a pressing need to ensure that youth in high HIV prevalence 
settings are prepared for a safer sexual debut. Smartphone ownership is
increasing dramatically in low-income and middle-income countries. Smartphone
games that are appropriately grounded in behavioral theory and evidence-based
practice have the potential to become valuable tools in youth HIV prevention
efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To pilot-test a theory-based, empirically grounded smartphone game for
young Kenyans designed to increase age and condom use at first sex, aiming to
establish directionality of effects on behavior change.
METHODS: Tumaini ("hope for the future" in Swahili) is an interactive,
narrative-based game grounded in social cognitive theory. A randomized controlled
pilot study was conducted in Kisumu, Western Kenya, from April to June 2017 with 
60 participants aged 11-14 (mean 12.7) years. Intervention arm participants
(n=30) were provided with an Android smartphone with Tumaini installed on it and 
were instructed to play the game for at least 1 hour a day for 16 days; control
arm participants (n=30) received no intervention. All participants completed a
survey on behavioral mediators, delivered via an audio computer-assisted
self-interview system at baseline (T1), post intervention (T2), and at 6 weeks
postintervention (T3). The postintervention survey for intervention arm
participants included questions eliciting feedback on the game. Intervention arm 
participants and their parents participated in 8 postintervention focus group
discussions. Game log files were analyzed to calculate the length of exposure to 
the game. Behavioral survey data were analyzed using two-sample t tests to
compare mean change from T1 to T2 and to T3 for intervention versus control arm
participants. Descriptive statistics on game feedback questions were computed.
Focus group transcripts were uploaded to MAXQDA software, where they were labeled
with deductive and inductive codes. Data were analyzed thematically and compared 
across demographics.
RESULTS: Intervention arm participants played Tumaini for a mean of approximately
27 hours. The intervention arm showed significant gains in sexual health-related 
knowledge and self-efficacy (both P<.001), behavioral intention for
risk-avoidance strategies and sexual risk communication (P=.006), and overall
survey scores (P<.001) compared with the control arm at T3. The postintervention 
survey revealed high subjective measures of the game's value, relevance, and
appeal. Focus groups identified a wide range of knowledge and skills the
participants had gained, including setting goals and planning how to achieve
them, which was perceived as a key motivator for avoiding or reducing risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the need for further research to assess the
efficacy of the game-based intervention. If proven efficacious, smartphone games 
have the potential to dramatically increase the reach of culturally adapted
behavioral interventions while ensuring fidelity to intervention design.

Retroviral protease inhibitors (RPIs) such as lopinavir (LP) and saquinavir (SQ) 
are active against Plasmodium parasites. However, the exact molecular target(s)
for these RPIs in the Plasmodium parasites remains poorly understood. We
hypothesised that LP and SQ suppress parasite growth through inhibition of
aspartyl proteases. Using reverse genetics approach, we embarked on separately
generating knockout (KO) parasite lines lacking Plasmepsin 4 (PM4), PM7, PM8, or 
DNA damage-inducible protein 1 (Ddi1) in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium
berghei ANKA. We then tested the suppressive profiles of the LP/Ritonavir (LP/RT)
and SQ/RT as well as antimalarials; Amodiaquine (AQ) and Piperaquine (PQ) against
the KO parasites in the standard 4-day suppressive test. The Ddi1 gene proved
refractory to deletion suggesting that the gene is essential for the growth of
the asexual blood stage parasites. Our results revealed that deletion of PM4
significantly reduces normal parasite growth rate phenotype (P = 0.003). Unlike
PM4_KO parasites which were less susceptible to LP and SQ (P = 0.036, P = 0.030),
the suppressive profiles for PM7_KO and PM8_KO parasites were comparable to those
for the WT parasites. This finding suggests a potential role of PM4 in the LP and
SQ action. On further analysis, modelling and molecular docking studies revealed 
that both LP and SQ displayed high binding affinities (-6.3 kcal/mol to -10.3
kcal/mol) towards the Plasmodium aspartyl proteases. We concluded that PM4 plays 
a vital role in assuring asexual stage parasite fitness and might be mediating LP
and SQ action. The essential nature of the Ddi1 gene warrants further studies to 
evaluate its role in the parasite asexual blood stage growth as well as a
possible target for the RPIs.

INTRODUCTION: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the commonest cause of valvular
heart disease and a common cause of heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Atrial fibrillation (AF) complicates RHD, precipitates and worsens heart failure 
and cause unfavourable outcomes. We set out to describe the prevalence, clinical 
characteristics and outcomes of valvular atrial fibrillation in a cohort of
African patients with acute heart failure (AHF).
METHODS: The sub-Saharan Africa Survey of Heart Failure (THESUS-HF) was a
prospective, observational survey of AHF in nine countries. We collected
demographic data, medical history and signs and symptoms of HF.
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were done in a standard fashion. AF was defined as
either a history of AF or AF on the admission ECG. Using Cox regression models,
we examined the associations of AF with all-cause death over 180 days and a
composite endpoint of all-cause death or readmission over 60 days.
RESULTS: There were 1 006 patients in the registry. The mean age was 52.3 years
and 50.8% were women. AF was present in 209 (20.8%) cases. Those with AF were
older (57.1 vs 51.1 years), more likely to be female (57.4 vs 49.1%), had
significantly lower systolic (125 vs 132 mmHg) and diastolic (81 vs 85 mmHg)
blood pressure (BP), and higher heart rates (109 vs 102 bpm). Ninety-two (44%) AF
patients had valvular heart disease. The presence of AF was not associated with
the primary endpoints, but having valvular AF predicted death within 180 days.
CONCLUSIONS: AF was present in one-fifth of African patients with AHF. Almost
half of the AF patients had valvular disease (RHD) and were significantly younger
and at risk of dying within six months. It is important to identify these
high-risk patients and prioritise their management, especially in SSA where
resources are limited.

Objective This study aimed to evaluate the performance of participants in the USA
compared with international participants taking the Pediatric Fundamental
Critical Care Support (PFCCS) course, and the significance of training for
resource-limited environments. Methods PFCCS courses were conducted in the USA,
El Salvador, Haiti, Kenya, and Nepal between January 2011 and July 2013. All of
the participants took pre- and post-tests. We compared the performance of these
tests between international and USA participants. All participants answered a
post-course survey to evaluate the didactic lectures and skill stations. Results 
A total of 244 participants took the PFCCS course, comprising 71 from the USA, 68
from Kenya, 37 from Haiti, 48 from Nepal, and 20 from El Salvador. The mean
pre-test score of USA participants (50.6%) was significantly higher than that of 
international participants (44.7%). There was no significant difference in the
post-test score between USA and international participants (78.6% versus 81.4%). 
There was a significant difference between pre- and post-test scores. There was
better appreciation of the course content by the USA participants. Conclusion
International course takers without prior pediatric intensive care training have 
similar test scores to USA participants suggesting comparable efficacy.

Background: Malaria continued to be the major public health concern in sub-Sahara
Africa, thus for better planning of control activities, periodic surveillance of 
both clinical and asymptomatic cases remains important. However, the usability of
routinely collected malaria data in Kenyan hospitals as a predictor of the
asymptomatic malaria infection in the community amidst rapid infection resurgence
or reduction in different areas of disease endemicities remains widely unstudied.
This study was therefore aimed to evaluate the utility of passive surveillance of
malaria in health facilities as a proxy of infection transmission of the
surrounding community in different transmission intensities.
Methods: Prospective multiple cross-sectional surveys were done in three villages
in western Kenya. Monthly asymptomatic malaria positivity among school children, 
number of outpatient (OPD) confirmed malaria cases and abundancy of indoor
resting malaria vectors were surveyed from June 2015 to August 2016. Community
surveys on antimalarial drug use among adults and children were also done.
Detection of malaria parasitaemia was done using thick and thin Giemsa stained
blood slide microscopy for both clinical and school participants. A questionnaire
was used to collect information on self-use of antimalarial drugs from randomly
selected households.
Results: The overall OPD blood slide positivity from all study sites was 26.6%
(95%CI 26.2-27.0) and highest being among the 5-14 years (41.2% (95% CI
40.1-42.3). Asymptomatic malaria positivity among the school children were 6.4%
(95%CI 5.3-7.5) and 38.3% (95%CI 36.1-40.5) in low and high transmission settings
respectively. A strong correlation between overall monthly OPD positivity and the
school age children positivity was evident at Marani (low transmission)
(rho = 0.78, p = 0.001) and at Iguhu (Moderate transmission) (rho = 0.61,
p = 0.02). The high transmission setting (Kombewa) showed no significant
correlation (rho = - 0.039, p = 0.89).
Conclusion: Hospital malaria data from low and moderate malaria transmission
predicted the infection transmission dynamics of the surrounding community. In
endemic sites, hospital based passive surveillance didn't predict the
asymptomatic infection dynamics in the respective community.

Sciences, Moi University, Eldoret, Kenya.

BACKGROUND: Family planning is an effective tool for preventing death among women
who do not want to become pregnant and has been shown to improve newborn health
outcomes, advance women's empowerment, and bring socioeconomic benefits through
reductions in fertility and population growth. Yet among the populations that
would benefit the most from family planning, uptake remains too low. The
emergence of digital health tools has created new opportunities to strengthen
health systems and promote behavior change. In this study, women with an unmet
need for family planning in Western Kenya were randomized to receive an
encouragement to try an automated investigational digital health intervention
that promoted the uptake of family planning.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the pilot study were to explore the feasibility of a
full-scale trial-in particular, the recruitment, encouragement, and follow-up
data collection procedures-and to examine the preliminary effect of the
intervention on contraception uptake.
METHODS: This pilot study tested the procedures for a randomized encouragement
trial. We recruited 112 women with an unmet need for family planning from local
markets in Western Kenya, conducted an eligibility screening, and randomized half
of the women to receive an encouragement to try the investigational intervention.
Four months after encouraging the treatment group, we conducted a follow-up
survey with enrolled participants via short message service (SMS) text message.
RESULTS: The encouragement sent via SMS text messages to the treatment group led 
to differential rates of intervention uptake between the treatment and control
groups; however, uptake by the treatment group was lower than anticipated (19/56,
33.9% vs 1/56, 1.8%, in the control group). Study attrition was also substantial.
We obtained follow-up data from 44.6% (50/112) of enrolled participants. Among
those in the treatment group who tried the intervention, the instrumental
variables estimate of the local average treatment effect was an increase in the
probability of contraceptive uptake of 41.0 percentage points (95% uncertainty
interval -0.03 to 0.85).
CONCLUSIONS: This randomized encouragement design and study protocol is feasible 
but requires modifications to the recruitment, encouragement, and follow-up data 
collection procedures.

BACKGROUND: Chemical-based malaria vector control interventions are threatened by
the development of insecticide resistance and changes in the behavior of the
vectors, and thus require the development of alternative control methods.
Bacterial-based larvicides have the potential to target both insecticide
resistant and outdoor-biting mosquitoes and are safe to use in the environment.
However, the currently available microbial larvicide formulations have a short
duration of activity requiring frequent re-applications which increase the cost
of control interventions. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and
duration of activity of two long-lasting formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis
var. israelensis (Bti) and Bacillus sphaericus (Bs) (LL3 and FourStar®) under
field conditions in western Kenya highlands.
METHODS: Three sites were selected for this study in the highlands of western
Kenya. In each site, one hundred anopheline larval habitats were selected and
assigned to one of three arms: (i) LL3; (ii) FourStar®; and (iii) untreated
control larval habitats. Four types of larval habitats were surveyed: abandoned
gold mines, drainage canals, fish ponds and non-fish ponds. The habitats were
sampled for mosquito larvae by using a standard dipping technique and collected
larvae were recorded according to the larval stages of the different Anopheles
species. The larvicides were applied at manufacturers' recommended dosage of 1
briquette per 100 square feet. Both treatment and control habitats were sampled
for mosquito larvae immediately before treatment (day 0), and then at 24 hours, 3
days and weekly post-treatment for 5 months.
RESULTS: Overall larval density in treatment habitats was significantly reduced
after application of the two microbial larvicides as compared to the control
habitats. Post-intervention reduction in anopheline larval density by LL3 was 65,
71 and 84% for 1 day, 2 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively. FourStar® reduced
anopheline larval density by 60, 66 and 80% for 1 day, 2 weeks and 4 weeks,
respectively. Comparisons between the treatments reveal that LL3 and FourStar®
were similar in efficacy. A higher reduction in Anopheles larval density was
observed in the abandoned goldmines, while drainage canals had the lowest
reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Both LL3 and FourStar® long-lasting microbial larvicides were
effective in reducing immature stages of An. gambiae complex and An. funestus
group species, with significant reductions lasting for three months
post-application.

Microbial water quality is frequently assessed with a risk indicator approach
that relies on Escherichia coli. Relying exclusively on E. coli is limiting,
particularly in low-resource settings, and we argue that risk assessments could
be improved by a complementary parameter, tryptophan-like fluorescence (TLF).
Over two campaigns (June 2016 and March 2017) we sampled 37 water points in rural
Kwale County, Kenya for TLF, E. coli and thermotolerant coliforms (total
n = 1082). Using three World Health Organization defined classes (very high,
high, and low/intermediate), risk indicated by TLF was not significantly
different from risk indicated by E. coli (p = 0.85). However, the TLF and E. coli
risk classifications did show disagreement, with TLF indicating higher risk for
14% of samples and lower risk for 13% of samples. Comparisons of
duplicate/replicate results demonstrated that precision is higher for TLF
(average relative percent difference of duplicates = 14%) compared to
culture-based methods (average RPD of duplicates ≥ 26%). Additionally, TLF
sampling is more practical because it requires less time and resources. Precision
and practicality make TLF well-suited to high-frequency sampling in low resource 
contexts. Interpretation and interference challenges are minimised when TLF is
measured in groundwaters, which typically have low dissolved organic carbon,
relatively consistent temperature, negligible turbidity and pH between 5 and 8.
TLF cannot be used as a proxy for E. coli on an individual sample basis, but it
can add value to groundwater risk assessments by improving prioritization of

BACKGROUND: Low adherence can undermine the efficacy of daily oral pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP). Mental health conditions, particularly depression, could be
associated with low PrEP adherence, especially for women.
SETTING: We analyzed data from 1013 Kenyan and Ugandan HIV-uninfected
participants in the Partners Demonstration Project, an open-label study of PrEP
delivered to HIV-uninfected members of serodiscordant couples.
METHODS: Participants completed quarterly visits over two years and were
encouraged to use PrEP until their partners living with HIV had ≥6 months of ART 
use (when viral suppression was expected). PrEP adherence was measured daily with
electronic MEMS caps and dichotomized into low (<80% of expected bottle openings)
and high adherence. Depression was assessed annually using the 16-item Hopkins
Symptom Checklist (HSCL-D) screening tool; scores >1.75 indicate "probable
depression". The association between probable depression and PrEP adherence was
assessed separately for men and women using generalized estimating equations and 
marginal structural models.
RESULTS: At enrollment, 39 (11.7% of 334) women and 64 (9.4% of 679) men reported
symptoms indicating probable depression, and these proportions decreased during
follow-up (p<0.001 for women and men). Probable depression was significantly
associated with low PrEP adherence among women (adjusted risk ratio=1.77; 95%
CI=1.14-2.77; p=0.01); there was no association between depression and adherence 
among men (p=0.50). Marginal structural models and sensitivity analyses confirmed
these findings.
CONCLUSION: Depression was relatively uncommon in this population and was an
independent risk factor for low PrEP adherence among women. For PrEP programs
targeting African women, integration of depression screening may improve PrEP
effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Low HIV testing uptake prevents identification of adolescents living 
with HIV and linkage to care and treatment. We implemented an innovative service 
package at health care facilities (HCFs) to improve HIV testing uptake and
linkage to care among adolescents aged 10-19 years in Western Kenya.
METHODS: This quasi-experimental study used pre- and post-intervention data at
139 HCFs (hospitals, health centers and dispensaries). The package included
health worker capacity building, program performance monitoring tools,
adolescent-focused HIV risk screening tool and adolescent-friendly hours.The
study population was divided into early (10-14 years) and late (15-19 years) age 
cohorts. Implementation began in July 2016, with pre-intervention data collected 
during January-March 2016 and post-intervention data collected during
January-March 2017. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the numbers of
adolescents tested for HIV, testing HIV-positive, and linked to care services.
Pre- and post-intervention demographic and testing data were compared using the
Poisson mean test. Chi-square testing was used to compare the linkage to care
rates.
RESULTS: During the pre-intervention period, 25,520 adolescents were tested, 198 
testing HIV-positive (0.8%) compared to 77,644 adolescents tested with 534
testing HIV-positive (0.7%) during the post-intervention period (both
p-values<0.001). The proportion of HIV-positive adolescents linked to care
increased from 61.6% to 94.0% (p<0.001). The increase in linkage to care was
observed among both age cohorts and within each facility type (both p-values
<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The adolescent-focused case finding intervention package led to a
significant increase in both HIV testing uptake and linkage to care services
among adolescents in Western Kenya.This is an open-access article distributed

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the extent of concordance
between positive screens for mental disorders by various trained community-based 
health workers using the WHO mental health Gap Action Programme Intervention
Guide (mhGAP-IG) and independently confirmed DSM-IV/ICD-10 diagnoses.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Makueni County, Kenya. 40 
nurses/clinical officers, 60 Community Health Workers (CHWs), 51 Faith Healers
(FHs), and 59 Traditional Healers (THs) from 20 facilities were trained to screen
and refer patients with eight priority mental health conditions using the
mhGAP-IG. These referrals, as well as referrals from friends or family members,
and self-referrals were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Instrument (M.I.N.I.) Plus. Concordance between positive screens and M.I.N.I.
Plus diagnoses was investigated.
RESULTS: 15,078 community members agreed to participate in screening. Of these
12,170 (81%) screened positive for a mental disorder and were referred to their
local clinics/hospitals. 8333 (68.5%) of those who were referred went for
independent diagnostic assessment at the nearest facility. Positive predictive
values varied with different providers and for different conditions. There was
over 80% concordance between the initial screen and the M.I.N.I. Plus diagnoses
across the different health providers and across all diagnoses.
CONCLUSION: Both formal and informal mental health providers can be trained to
successfully and accurately screen for mental health disorders using the mhGAP-IG
symptoms. This suggests that community-based non-specialist providers may play a 
key role in decreasing the mental health treatment gap. Further policy
implications are discussed.

Introduction: Antiretroviral therapy plays a major role in reducing the impact of
Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Disease Syndrome, especially in
resource-limited settings. However, without proper infrastructure, it has
resulted in emergence of drug resistance mutations in infected populations. To
determine drug resistance mutations among patients attending a comprehensive care
facility in Nairobi, 65 blood samples were successfully sequenced.
Methods: Whole blood samples were also tested for CD4+T-cell count and plasma
HIV-1 RNA Viral load. Drug-resistance testing targeting the HIV-1 RT gene was
determined. Patients were on first line ART that consisted of two NRTIs, and one 
NNRTI.
Results: Females were younger (mean 42) than males (mean 45) and lower median
CD4+ counts (139 cells/μl) than males (152 cells/μl). The prevalence of drug
resistance mutations (any major mutation) in this population was 23.1% (15/65).
Major NRTI mutations were detected in 11 patient samples, which included M184V (n
= 6), M41L (n=3), D67N (n=2), K219Q (n=3) and T215F (n=2). Major NNRTI mutations 
were detected in 14 patient samples. They included K103N (n = 10), G190A (n = 1),
Y181C (n = 1) and Y188L (n = 1).
Conclusion: Presence of major mutations in this study calls for proper laboratory
infrastructure to monitor treatment as well as regular appraisals of available
regimens.

College London, London, UK.

Background: Preterm birth occurs among 9.6% of births worldwide and is the
leading cause of long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities among children and
also responsible for 28% of neonatal deaths. No single etiological factor is
responsible for preterm birth, but various risk factors have been identified.
Prior studies have reported that compromised maternal mental health occurring
during pregnancy may lead to various adverse obstetric outcomes.
Objective: To determine whether antenatal depression is significantly associated 
with preterm delivery in a low resource hospital sample from suburbs of Nairobi.
Methods: 292 women attending the antenatal clinic at Pumwani Maternity Hospital
in Nairobi meeting the study criteria were recruited. The Edinburgh Postnatal
Depression Scale was administered to screen for depression. A clinical cutoff
score of 10 and above was regarded as possible depression. Thereafter, a clinical
interview together with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was administered to
evaluate the participants on DSM-V criteria for major depressive disorder. Only
255 of the women were successfully followed-up to delivery with an attrition rate
of 12.7%. Records of gestation at delivery and birth weight were collected at
second contact.
Data analysis: Preterm birth was associated with various demographic,
psychosocial and medical variables. Relative risks were estimated via log
binomial regression analysis to determine whether depression was a risk factor
for preterm birth.
Results: Of the 255 participants, 98(38.4%) found to have depressive symptoms and
27(10.7%) delivered preterm. The risk of delivering preterm was 3.8 times higher 
among those with depressive symptoms.
Conclusion: There is a positive association between antenatal depression and
preterm delivery. This highlights the importance of screening for mental health
challenges in the antenatal period as a means to reduce adverse obstetric
outcomes.

Khat (Catha edulis Forsk) - And now there are three.

For centuries, a large number of people living in the southwestern part of the
Arabian Peninsula and eastern Africa have chewed the fresh leaves and twigs of
the plant Catha edulis Forsk, more commonly known as khat, for its
psychostimulatory effect. The main active compound in khat is cathinone, whose
synthetic derivatives form a part of the new psychoactive substances list. This
review summaries the prevalence of khat use, its harvesting and consumption, the 
biosynthetic pathway in khat, the mechanism of action, the results from animal
and human studies, and its dependence potential. It is unlikely that khat use
will be prohibited in countries where it is traditionally consumed and socially
acceptable unlike in other countries of the world where both the importation and 
the consumption of khat and cathinone is banned. Khat users being mainly Muslims 
prohibited from using alcohol or other drugs probably represent the largest
global number of mono-drug users of an amphetamine-like stimulant. Thus, khat use
represents a unique situation and a neglected area of research in Africa.

Although abortion is now legal in Kenya under expanded circumstances, access is
limited and many providers and individuals still believe it is illegal. This
study aimed to characterise Kenyan women's perceptions and experiences with
abortion and post-abortion care (PAC) services in Nairobi regarding barriers to
care, beliefs about abortion, and perceived stigma. We conducted 15
semi-structured in-depth interviews with Kenyan women aged 18-24 years who
recently received abortion and PAC services at four Marie Stopes Kenya clinic
sites in Nairobi. The most significant psychosocial barrier respondents faced in 
promptly seeking abortion and PAC was perceived stigma. In response to stigma,
participants developed a sense of agency and self-reliance, which allowed them to
prioritise their own healthcare needs over the concerns of others. To adequately 
address perceived stigma as a barrier to abortion- and PAC-seeking, significant
cultural norm shifting is required.

Introduction: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is an important risk factor for chronic
respiratory disease due to residual lung damage. Yet, the WHO End TB strategy
does not mention post-TB chronic lung disorders (PTBLDs) and programmatic
interventions to address PTBLD are lacking. This study assessed the scope of
current guidelines and evidence on PTBLD to inform policy and research action.
Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted following Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Eight
databases (TRIP, International Guideline Library, MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of 
Science, Global Health, Cochrane Library) were searched for records on PTBLD
published between 1 January 1990 and 1 December 2017. Non-English records, case
series, conference abstracts and letters to editors were excluded. Data were
extracted and charted on publication year, location, PTBLD condition(s) and main 
study outcome.
Results: A total of 212 guidelines and 3661 articles were retrieved. After
screening, only three international TB guidelines mentioned TB sequelae, but none
described how to identify or manage the condition. A total of 156 articles
addressed PTBLD: 54 (35%) mentioned unspecified TB sequelae; 47 (30%) specific
post-TB conditions including aspergillosis, bronchial stenosis or bronchiectasis;
52 (33%) post-TB obstructive disorders or lung function impairment; and 20 (13%) 
post-TB respiratory symptoms or chest X-ray abnormalities. The first two groups
mostly assessed surgery or ventilation techniques for patient management, while
the last two groups typically assessed prevalence or predictors of disease.
Conclusion: This is the first review to provide a comprehensive overview of the
current literature on PTBLD. The scope of evidence around the burden of PTBLD
warrants inclusion and recognition of the problem in international TB guidelines.
Research is now needed on early detection of PTBLD and patient management options
that are suitable for high-burden TB countries.

Objective: The study aimed at quantifying seasonal and spatial variations in
availability and nutritive value of herbaceous vegetation on native pastures and 
supplement feedstuffs for domestic ruminants in Western Kenya.
Methods: Samples of the herbaceous pasture vegetation (n=75) and local supplement
feedstuffs (n=46) for cattle, sheep, and goats were collected in 20 villages of
three geographic zones (Highlands, Mid-slopes, Lowlands) in Lower Nyando, Western
Kenya, over four seasons of one year. Concentrations of dry matter (DM), crude
ash (CA), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), 
gross energy (GE), and minerals were determined. Apparent total tract organic
matter digestibility (dOM) was estimated from in vitro gas production and
proximate nutrient concentrations or chemical composition alone using published
prediction equations.
Results: Nutrient, energy, and mineral concentrations were 52 to 168 g CA, 367 to
741 g NDF, 32 to 140 g CP, 6 to 45 g EE, 14.5 to 18.8 MJ GE, 7.0 to 54.2 g
potassium, 0.01 to 0.47 g sodium, 136 to 1825 mg iron, and 0.07 to 0.52 mg
selenium/kg DM. The dOM was 416 to 650 g/kg organic matter but differed depending
on the estimation method. Nutritive value of pasture herbage was superior to most
supplement feedstuffs, but its value strongly declined in the driest season.
Biomass yields and concentrations of CP and potassium in pasture herbage were
highest in the Highlands amongst the three zones.
Conclusions: Availability and nutritive value of pasture herbage and supplement
feedstuffs greatly vary between seasons and geographical zones, suggesting need
for season- and region-specific feeding strategies. Local supplement feedstuffs
partly compensate for nutritional deficiencies. However, equations to accurately 
predict dOM and improved knowledge on nutritional characteristics of tropical
ruminant feedstuffs are needed to enhance livestock production in this and
similar environments.

BACKGROUND: Male circumcision provides men with approximately 60% protection from
acquiring HIV infection via heterosexual sex, and has become a key component of
HIV prevention efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Possible mechanisms for this
protection include removal of the inflammatory anaerobic sub-preputial
environment and the high concentration of Langerhans cells on the inside of the
foreskin, both believed to promote local vulnerability to HIV infection. In
people who do acquire HIV, viral load is partially determined by infecting
partner viral load, potentially mediated by size of infecting inoculum. By
removing a portal for virion entry, prior male circumcision could decrease
infecting inoculum and thus viral load in men who become HIV-infected, conferring
the known associated benefits of slower progression to disease and decreased
infectiousness.
METHODS: We performed an as-treated analysis of plasma samples collected under a 
randomized controlled trial of male circumcision for HIV prevention, comparing
men based on their circumcision status at the time of HIV acquisition, to
determine whether circumcision is associated with lower viral load. Eligible men 
were seroconverters who had at least one plasma sample available drawn at least 6
months after infection, reported no potential exposures other than vaginal sex
and, for those who were circumcised, were infected more than 6 weeks after
circumcision, to eliminate the open wound as a confounder. Initial viral load
testing indicated that quality of pre-2007 samples might have been compromised
during storage and they were excluded, as were those with undetectable or
unquantifiable results. Log viral loads were compared between groups using
univariable and multivariable linear regression, adjusting for sample age and
sexually transmitted infection diagnosis with 3.5 months of seroconversion, with 
a random effect for intra-individual clustering for samples from the same man. A 
per-protocol analysis was also performed.
RESULTS: There were no viral load differences between men who were circumcised
and uncircumcised at the time of HIV infection (means 4.00 and 4.03 log10
copies/mL respectively, p = .88) in any analysis.
CONCLUSION: Circumcision status at the time of HIV infection does not affect
viral load in men.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The original RCT which provided the samples was
ClinicalTrials.gov trial NCT00059371 .

BACKGROUND: This is a facility-based study designed to assess perceived quality
of care and satisfaction of reproductive health services under the output-based
approach (OBA) services in Kenya from clients' perspective.
METHOD: An exit interview was conducted on 254 clients in public health
facilities, non-governmental organizations, faith-based organizations and private
facilities in Kitui, Kilifi, Kiambu, and Kisumu counties as well as in the
Korogocho and Viwandani slums in Nairobi, Kenya using a 23-item scale
questionnaire on quality of reproductive health services. Descriptive analysis,
exploratory factor analysis, reliability test, and subgroup analysis using linear
regression were performed.
RESULTS: Clients generally had a positive view on staff conduct and healthcare
delivery but were neutral on hospital physical facilities, resources, and access 
to healthcare services. There was a high overall level of satisfaction among the 
clients with quick service, good handling of complications, and clean hospital
stated as some of the reasons that enhanced satisfaction. The County of residence
was shown to impact the perception of quality greatly with other social
demographic characteristics showing low impact.
CONCLUSION: Majority of the women perceived the quality of OBA services to be
high and were happy with the way healthcare providers were handling birth related
complications. The conduct and practice of healthcare workers is an important
determinant of client's perception of quality of reproductive and maternal health
services. Findings can be used by health care managers as a guide to evaluate
different areas of healthcare delivery and to improve resources and physical
facilities that are crucial in elevating clients' level of satisfaction.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine if a school support
intervention for adolescent orphans in Kenya had effects on mental health, a
secondary outcome.
METHODS: In this paper, we analyzed data from a 4-year cluster-randomized trial
of a school support intervention (school uniforms, school fees, and nurse visits)
conducted with orphaned adolescents in Siaya County, western Kenya, who were
about to transition to secondary school. 26 primary schools were randomized (1:1)
to intervention (410 students) or control (425 students) arms. The study was
longitudinal with annual repeated measures collected over 4 years from 2011 to
2014. We administered five items from the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale Revised, a self-reported depression screening
instrument.
RESULTS: The intervention prevented depression severity scores from increasing
over time among adolescents recruited from intervention schools. There was no
evidence of treatment heterogeneity by gender or baseline depression status. The 
intervention effect on depression was partially mediated by higher levels of
continuous school enrollment among the intervention group, but this mediated
effect was small.
CONCLUSIONS: School support for orphans may help to buffer against the onset or
worsening of depression symptoms over time, promoting resilience among an
important at-risk population.

Background: There is little information on the causes of low birth weight (LBW,
<2500 g) in South Kivu. The authors determined the prevalence of LBW among
full-term newborns, and its relationship with malaria and anaemia at the first
antenatal visit (ANV1) in the rural health zone of Miti-Murhesa, in the eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Methods: Four-hundred-and-seventy-eight pregnant women in the second trimester
attending their first antenatal clinic were recruited between November 2010 and
July 2011, and followed-up until delivery. Besides information on use of
preventive measures and malaria morbidity, anthropometric measures and a blood
sample were collected.
Results: Women's mean age (SD) at enrolment, was 26 (6.5) years (n=434);
prevalence of malaria was 9.5% (43/453) and that of anaemia 32.2% (141/439). The 
latter was significantly more frequent in malaria-infected women and in those who
had not been dewormed. At delivery, prevalence of LBW was 6.5% (23/355) and was
independently associated with not sleeping under insecticide-treated bed net
(p=0.030), mother's height <150 cm (p=0.001) and anaemia at the ANV1 (p=0.006).
Conclusion: In South Kivu, malaria and anaemia are important risk factors for
LBW, and should be prevented among all women of reproductive age.

Clinical leadership is recognized as a crucial element in health system
strengthening and health policy globally yet it has received relatively little
attention in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Moreover, analyses of
clinical leadership tend to focus on senior-level individual leaders, overlooking
a wider constellation of middle-level leaders delivering health care in practice 
in a way affected by their health care context. Using the theoretical lens of
'distributed leadership', this article examines how middle-level leadership is
practised and affected by context in Kenyan county hospitals, providing insights 
relevant to health care in other LMICs. The article is based on empirical
qualitative case studies of clinical departmental leadership in two Kenyan public
hospitals, drawing on data gathered through ethnographic observation, interviews 
and focus groups. We inductively and iteratively coded, analysed and theorized
our findings. We found the distributed leadership lens useful for the purpose of 
analysing middle-level leadership in Kenyan hospitals, although clinical
departmental leadership was understood locally in more individualized terms. Our 
distributed lens revealed medical and nursing leadership occurring in parallel
and how only doctors in leadership roles were able to directly influence
behaviour among their medical colleagues, using inter-personal skills, power and 
professional expertize. Finally, we found that Kenyan hospital contexts were
characterized by cultures, norms and structures that constrained the way
leadership was practiced. We make a theoretical contribution by demonstrating the
utility of using distributed leadership as a lens for analysing leadership in
LIMC health care contexts, revealing how context, power and inter-professional
relationships moderate individual leaders' ability to bring about change. Our
findings, have important implications for how leadership is conceptualized and
the way leadership development and training are provided in LMICs health systems.

Introducing the Progesterone Vaginal Ring (PVR) as a New Option for Postpartum
Family Planning in Sub-Saharan Africa: Insights from Engagements with
Stakeholders.

The progesterone vaginal ring (PVR) is a ring-shaped device designed for use by
women in the postpartum period to regulate fertility by complementing and
extending the contraceptive effectiveness of lactational amenorrhea to suppress
ovulation.1 It is available in eight Latin American countries for use by
breastfeeding women who want more effective modern contraceptives in addition to 
contraceptive benefits provided by lactational amenorrhea alone.1 The PVR is a
method that can be suitable to women in sub-Saharan Africa, given the
near-universal practice of breastfeeding and the current level of unmet need for 
contraception in the postpartum period. Efforts are currently underway to
introduce the PVR in Africa and south Asia. To ensure a seamless introduction,
scale up and sustainability of the PVR in the region, the Population Council
conducted pre-introductory activities with stakeholders in Kenya, Nigeria and
Senegal to determine the level of interest in the ring, potential facilitating
and mitigating factors and identify solutions to address challenges. The research
team combined three approaches: in-depth interviews with family planning
stakeholders; desk review of reports and policy guidelines; and in-group
meetings. The stakeholders reached included public sector officials including
policy makers and program managers, implementing partners, regulators, women and 
religious networks. All three countries had a promising policy and programmatic
context that was supportive to PVR introduction. The exercise provided insights
on socio-cultural and religious factors that could potentially impact how the PVR
is perceived within communities and identified possible remedies to address
misperceptions. It also paved the way for the conduct of an acceptability study
of the PVR among breastfeeding women in these countries. The high acceptability
rate in each country and the support expressed by government and other
stakeholders have provided impetus for registration of the product in each
country. Learning from this process could also direct how other family planning
and reproductive health commodities would be introduced in the future.

INTRODUCTION: Although hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mainly transmitted via the
faecal-oral route, the rate of HEV transmission via blood donation is on the
rise. However, the seroprevalence of HEV among blood donors is not well
established and is thought to be affected by the type of diagnostic assay used.
We aimed to evaluate performance and correlation among widely used commercial
diagnostic assays for the seroprevalence assessment of HEV-IgM/IgG among blood
donors.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 1049 blood donor samples were tested for HEV IgG and IgM 
using different enzyme immunoassays (Wantai, Eruoimmune, MP diagnostics, Mikrogen
immunoblot, HEV-IgM rapid test). The performance of each assay was evaluated
according to our established silver standard value based on three or more IgG
concordant assay results.
RESULTS: HEV seroprevalence varied considerably using these assays, ranging from 
10.1 % (Euroimmune-ELISA) to 18.0 % (Wanti-ELISA) for HEV-IgG, and from 0.2 %
(Wanti-ELISA) to 2.6 % (MP Rapid test) for HEV-IgM. A total of 155 of 216 (71.6%)
samples tested positive for HEV-IgG by three or more concordant assays. On the
other hand, IgM assays showed poor agreement as only 7.6 % (4/52) of the
specimens were positive according to three or more concordant assay test results.
All HEV-IgG assays revealed high sensitivity and specificity (ranging
96.5-100 %),and excellent Kappa concordance (0.88-0.95), except for Euroimmun
ELISA (sensitivity=61.5 %, kappa=0.63). MP ELISA showed the highest levels of
sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (98.5 %).
CONCLUSIONS: Due to discrepancies in the performance of various IgG and IgM
assays, seroprevalence studies should be based on furher confirmatory testing for
decisive conclusions to be reached.

PURPOSE: Traditional and complementary alternative medicine (TCAM) use is rising 
globally. In many African countries, TCAM has been a way of life as the first and
last resort remedy for many ailments, including cancer. Health-care providers
(HCP) should address this need properly. This study explores HCP perspectives on 
TCAM in Kenya.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used questionnaires. HCP involved in the care
of children with cancer at a Kenyan academic hospital were interviewed.
RESULTS: In total, 155 HCP (response rate 79%) participated. Only 18% of HCP were
positive about TCAM use. However, most HCP (85%) use TCAM themselves. More
doctors (90%) than other HCP (56%) think that chemotherapy can cure cancer
(P < 0.001).Thirty-three percent of HCP believe a combination of TCAM and
chemotherapy is the best way to cure cancer, while 56% think that usefulness of
TCAM is underestimated in conventional medicine. Self-prayer is regarded as most 
effective (58%) and safe (76%). Most harmful is witchcraft (80%). Most HCP (71%) 
think their knowledge about safety and efficacy of TCAM is inadequate. HCP think 
that their cancer patients use TCAM (97%) and that it is important that parents
inform them about this (97%). However, only 5% of HCP always openly discuss TCAM 
with parents.
CONCLUSIONS: HCP need to improve their knowledge of TCAM and facilitate open
communication about TCAM with families so parents feel safe to discuss their
interest in it.

Some HIV-infected individuals in research studies may choose not to disclose
knowledge of their HIV status to study staff. We evaluated the accuracy of
self-reported HIV status among African men and transgender women who have sex
with men and who were screened for a research study. Sixty-seven of 183
HIV-infected participants reported a prior HIV diagnosis. Samples from the
remaining 116 participants were tested for antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Thirty-six
of the 116 participants had ARV drugs detected, indicating that they were on
antiretroviral treatment; these participants were classified as previously
diagnosed based on ARV drug testing. Among participants classified as previously 
diagnosed, disclosure of a prior HIV diagnosis varied among study sites
(p = 0.006) and was more common among those who reported having sex with men only
(p = 0.002). ARV drug testing in addition to self-report improves the accuracy
for identifying individuals with a prior HIV diagnosis.

Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the extent of
self-medication of antibiotics and dispensing practices in Kenya.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out at three selected pharmacies in 
Nairobi (Kenya), between January and March 2017, targeting principally antibiotic
prescriptions for systemic use issued and dispensed as well as antibiotics sold
over-the-counter without a prescription. The quality of antibiotics prescribed
and dispensed was assessed against key WHO and other criteria. Benchmarking was
used to assess the quality of antibiotics prescribed as there are no
predetermined levels, just guidance and the rationale. Key indicators included:
utilization of penicillins, percentage utilization of third-and fourth-generation
of cephalosporins versus first and second generation, utilization of macrolides
including lincosamides and utilization of quinolones as a percent of total
systemic antibiotic use.
Findings: There was a low level of dispensing of antibiotics without a
prescription with over 90% (94.1%) of antibiotics dispensed with a valid
prescription. The most common antibiotics dispensed were the penicillins at just 
over 50% of all antibiotics, the cephalosporins at over 12% (12.6%) and the
fluoroquinolones at just under 12% (11.7%). There were concerns with high use of 
third and fourth generation cephalosporins versus first- and second-generation as
well as co-amoxiclav versus other penicillins.
Conclusion: Low levels of self-medication of antibiotics and high adherence to
quality standards for dispensing are encouraging and provide direction to other
countries. Educational initiatives are needed though to address high levels of
co-amoxiclav prescribing.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease that is characterized by periodic
and severe outbreaks in humans and animals. Published information on the
occurrence of RVF in domestic animals is very scarce in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC). To assess possible circulation of Rift Valley fever virus
(RVFV) in cattle in the eastern province of DRC, 450 sera collected from cattle
in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces were analyzed using the
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for the detection of viral
Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and M, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR), for detection of viral RVF RNA. A cumulative anti-RVF IgG prevalence of
6.22% (95% CI 4.25-8.97) was recorded from the three provinces sampled. In North 
Kivu and Ituri provinces the anti-RVF IgG prevalence was 12.67% [95% CI
7.80-19.07] and 6% [95% CI 2.78-11.08], respectively, while all the sera
collected from South Kivu province were negative for anti-RVF IgG antibodies.
Anti-RVF IgM prevalence of 1.8% was obtained among sampled animals in the three
provinces. None of the positive anti-RVF IgM samples (n=8) was positive for viral
RVFV RNA using RT-PCR. Our findings suggest that RVFV is widely distributed among
cattle in eastern province of DRC particularly in North Kivu and Ituri provinces 
although the epidemiological factors supporting this virus circulation remain
unknown in these areas.

Morphological and molecular techniques were used to investigate the presence of
hemogregarines and haemosporidians in biological samples of free-living
Geoffroy's side-necked turtles (Phrynops geoffroanus) and Giant Amazon turtles
(Podocnemis expansa) from Brazil. No evolutionary form of haemosporidians or
hemogregarines were observed in the blood smears of 83 P. geoffroanus samples,
and there were no meronts in the histological sections of 31 necropsied P.
geoffroanus samples. All DNA samples extracted from P. geoffroanus tissues and
blood aliquots were negative in haemosporidian PCR assays (based on the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene) and hemogregarine PCR assays (based on the 18S
rRNA gene). In the analysis of blood smears of all seven Podocnemis expansa
evaluated, gametocytes of hemogregarines were observed. The seven P. expansa were
negative in the haemosporidian PCR assays. Moreover, hemogregarine DNA was
detected in blood samples from all of the sampled P. expansa. The phylogenetic
maximum likelihood inference and probabilistic Bayesian inference revealed five
closely related genotypes that formed a monophyletic group. There was also a
sister group to the lineage that consisted of Haemogregarina spp. of freshwater
turtles from Canada, Italy, Mozambique, Kenya, Gabon, Vietnam, and China. The
findings suggest that free-living P. expansa were parasitized by a new genotype
or even a possible new species of the genus Haemogregarina. Haemosporidians and
hemogregarines are not frequently found in P. geoffroanus in the studied region
under the local conditions of that period.

Introduction: Increased survival of preterm babies in sub-saharan Africa has held
to an increasing prevalence of Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). This study was
done to determine the ROP prevalence in a hospital with advanced neonatal care in
urban Kenya.
Methods: A hospital-based retrospective review of the records of premature
infants screened for ROP between January 2010 and December 2015. Records of all
premature infants screened for ROP in the neonatal unit and outpatient eye clinic
were extracted. Information on Birth weights, Gestational age, Maternal risk
factors (mode of delivery, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia) and Neonatal risk factors
(neonatal sepsis, days on oxygen, blood transfusion) was recorded in a
questionnaire then analysed.
Results: 103 infants were included in the study. Mean gestational age was 29.9 ± 
2.2 weeks and the mean birth weight was 1280.1 ± 333.0 grams. Forty-three infants
were diagnosed with ROP, a prevalence of 41.7%. Majority of these had Stage 1 or 
2 ROP in Zone II, which spontaneously regressed with follow up. Nine infants were
diagnosed with vision-threatening ROP (any Zone I disease or Stage 2/3 disease in
Zone II with plus disease), a prevalence of 20.9%. All of these underwent laser
treatment in the neonatal unit. The most significant risk factor was low
gestational age. Other risk factors identified were: low birth weight and blood
transfusions.
Conclusion: ROP prevalence in sub-saharan Africa will match those in
middle-income and high income countries in neonatal units with advanced care and 
low mortality.

BACKGROUND: Many low- and middle-income countries are facing a double burden of
disease with persisting high levels of infectious disease, and an increasing
prevalence of non-communicable disease (NCD). Within these settings, complex
processes and transitions concerning health and population are underway, altering
population dynamics and patterns of disease. Understanding the mechanisms through
which changing socioeconomic and environmental contexts may influence health is
central to developing appropriate public health policy. Migration, which involves
a change in environment and health exposure, is one such mechanism.
METHODS: This study uses Competing Risk Models to examine the relationship
between internal migration and premature mortality from AIDS/TB and NCDs. The
analysis employs 9 to 14 years of longitudinal data from four Health and
Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) of the INDEPTH Network located in Kenya
and South Africa (populations ranging from 71 to 223 thousand). The study tests
whether the mortality of migrants converges to that of non-migrants over the
period of observation, controlling for age, sex and education level.
RESULTS: In all four HDSS, AIDS/TB has a strong influence on overall deaths.
However, in all sites the probability of premature death (45q15) due to AIDS/TB
is declining in recent periods, having exceeded 0.39 in the South African sites
and 0.18 in the Kenyan sites in earlier years. In general, the migration effect
presents similar patterns in relation to both AIDS/TB and NCD mortality, and
shows a migrant mortality disadvantage with no convergence between migrants and
non-migrants over the period of observation. Return migrants to the Agincourt
HDSS (South Africa) are on average four times more likely to die of AIDS/TB or
NCDs than are non-migrants. In the Africa Health Research Institute (South
Africa) female return migrants have approximately twice the risk of dying from
AIDS/TB from the year 2004 onwards, while there is a divergence to higher AIDS/TB
mortality risk amongst female migrants to the Nairobi HDSS from 2010.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that structural socioeconomic issues, rather than
epidemic dynamics are likely to be associated with differences in mortality risk 
by migrant status. Interventions aimed at improving recent migrant's access to
treatment may mitigate risk.

BACKGROUND: Access to essential medicines in pediatric endocrinology and diabetes
is limited in resource-limited countries. The World Health Organization (WHO)
maintains two non-binding lists of essential medicines (EMLs) which are often
used as a template for developing national EMLs.
METHODS: We compared a previously published master list of medicines for
pediatric endocrinology and diabetes with the WHO EMLs and national EMLs for
countries within the WHO African region. To better understand actual access to
medicines by patients, we focused on diabetes and surveyed pediatric
endocrinologists from 5 countries and assessed availability and true cost for
insulin and glucagon.
RESULTS: Most medicines that are essential in pediatric endocrinology and
diabetes were included in the national EMLs. However, essential medicines, such
as fludrocortisone, were present in less than 30% of the national EMLs despite
being recommended by the WHO. Pediatric endocrinologists from the 5 focus
countries reported significant variation in terms of availability and public
access to insulin, as well as differences between urban and rural areas. Except
for Botswana, glucagon was rarely available. There was no significant
relationship between Gross National Income and the number of medicines included
in the national EMLs.
CONCLUSIONS: Governments in resource-limited countries could take further steps
to improve EMLs and access to medicines such as improved collaboration between
health authorities, the pharmaceutical industry, patient groups, health
professionals, and capacity-building programs such as Paediatric Endocrinology
Training Centres for Africa.

OBJECTIVE: To compare accuracy of detecting high-grade cervical lesions (squamous
intraepithelial lesions or greater, HSIL+) by high-risk HPV messenger RNA
(hrHPV-RNA) testing between physician- and self-collected specimens, and by
conventional cytology.
METHODS: The present prospective longitudinal study included data collected among
female sex workers (FSWs) in Nairobi, Kenya, between December 2, 2009, and
February 15, 2013. Participants self-collected cervico-vaginal specimens for
hrHPV-RNA testing, and a physician collected cervical specimens for hrHPV-RNA
testing and conventional cytology. hrHPV-RNA testing was conducted every 3
months, and conventional cytology every 6 months.
RESULTS: Overall, 350 FSWs aged 18-50 years participated. hrHPV-RNA prevalence
decreased slightly from 29.9% (103/344) at baseline to 24.3% (53/218) at 24
months for physician-collected, and 28.5% (98/344) to 24.3% (53/218) for
self-collected specimens. Agreement between the sampling methods appeared to
increase over time (baseline κ 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-0.65; 24
months κ 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.91). Among 21 patients with HSIL+ over 24 months, 18
(86%) and 17 (81%) had hrHPV-RNA-positive results at baseline in physician- and
self-collected specimens, respectively; and 20 (95%) had baseline
hrHPV-RNA-positive results or cytology anomalies.
CONCLUSION: Overall agreement between physician- and self-collected hrHPV-RNA
results was moderate and appeared to increase over time. Baseline physician- and 
self-collected hrHPV-RNA tests were similarly strong indicators of cumulative
HSIL+ over 24 months. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

INTRODUCTION: At its basic level, HIV infection requires a replication-competent 
virus and a susceptible target cell. Elevated levels of vaginal inflammation has 
been associated with the increased risk of HIV infection as it brings highly
activated HIV target cells (CCR5+CD4+ T cells; CCR5+CD4+CD161+ Th17 T cells) to
the female genital tract (FGT) where they interact with HIV. Decreased HIV risk
has been associated with a phenotype of decreased immune activation, called
immune quiescence, described among Kenyan female sex workers who were intensely
exposed to HIV yet remain uninfected. Current prevention approaches focus on
limiting viral access. We took the novel HIV prevention approach of trying to
limit the number of HIV target cells in the genital tract by reducing
inflammation using safe, affordable and globally accessible anti-inflammatory
drugs.
METHODS: We hypothesized that the daily administration of low doses of
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA 81 mg) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ 200 mg) would reduce 
inflammation thereby decreasing HIV target cells at the FGT. Low-risk HIV
seronegative women from Nairobi, Kenya were randomized for six weeks therapy of
ASA (n = 37) or HCQ (n = 39) and tested to determine the impact on their systemic
and mucosal immune environment.
RESULTS: The results showed that HCQ use was associated with a significant
reduction in the proportion of systemic T cells that were CCR5+CD4+ (p = 0.01)
and Th17 (p = 0.01). In the ASA arm, there was a 35% and 28% decrease in the
proportion of genital T cells that were CD4+CCR5+ (p = 0.017) and Th17 (p = 0.04)
respectively. Proteomic analyses of the cervical lavage showed ASA use was
associated with significantly reduced amount of proteins involved in the
inflammatory response and cell recruitment at the mucosa, although none of the
individual proteins passed multiple comparison correction. These changes were
more apparent in women with Lactobacillus dominant microbiomes.
CONCLUSION: Together, these data indicate that taking low-dose ASA daily was
associated with significant reduction in HIV target cells at the FGT. This study 
provides proof-of-concept for a novel HIV-prevention approach that reducing
inflammation using safe, affordable and globally accessible non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory agents is associated with significant reduction in the
proportion of HIV-target cells at the FGT.

Background Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services are
critical to achieve national and global targets of 90% antiretroviral therapy
(ART) coverage in PMTCT, and mother to child transmission rates less than 5%. In 
2012, Kenya adopted WHO's recommended ART regimen for PMTCT "Option B+". Aims
This study assesses progress made in adopting these new guidelines and associated
outcomes. Methods We analysed programmatic data of 2604 mother-infant pairs
enrolled in the HIV Infant Tracking System (HITSystem) at four government
hospitals in Kenya between January, 2013 and December, 2016. We then compared
PMTCT trends between 2010 and 2012 and 2013-2016 for the same four government
hospitals. Results A total of 2,371 (91.1%) received some ART regimen, however;
only 911 (56.2%) mothers received ART regimens compliant with WHO Option B+. From
2013 to 2016, the percent of mothers on WHO Option B + doubled from 42 to 84%
(p < 0.001), the mean week of ART initiation decreased from 19.0 to 9.7 weeks
(p < 0.001), the percent of pregnant women who were already on ART at the time of
PMTCT enrolment increased from 5.8 to 31.7% (p < 0.001), and the paediatric
transmission rate decreased from 5.9 to 2.5% (p = 0.002). Conclusion Comparing
data at these four Kenyan hospitals indicates significant progress has been made 
from 2010 to 2016. To continue these positive gains, concerted focus will be
needed to target and improve the integration of new guidelines into clinical
practice at the facility level, adherence to treatment and retention in care.

The mainstay in prevention and treatment of aspergillosis is the use triazole
drugs. In Kenya, the use of agricultural azole is one of the predisposing factors
in development of resistance. One hundred fifty-six (156) experienced soils were 
collected from agricultural farms and cultured on Sabouraud DextroseAagar. The
study isolated 48 yielded Aspergillus fumigatus and 2 A. flavus. All the isolates
were subjected to antifungal susceptibility testing against three triazoles:
posaconazole, voriconazole, and itraconazole. Out of the isolates, 3 had MIC of
32 and 1 had MIC of 16 against itraconazole, and 1 isolate had MIC of 32 against 
posaconazole. CYP51A gene was sequenced, and TR34/L98H mutation was identified.
Triazole resistance existing in Kenya calls for rational use of azole-based
fungicides in agriculture over concerns of emerging antifungal resistance in
clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: HIV risk remains unacceptably high among adolescent girls and young
women (AGYW) in southern and eastern Africa, reflecting structural and social
inequities that drive new infections. In 2015, PEPFAR (the United States
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) with private-sector partners launched
the DREAMS Partnership, an ambitious package of interventions in 10 sub-Saharan
African countries. DREAMS aims to reduce HIV incidence by 40% among AGYW over two
years by addressing multiple causes of AGYW vulnerability. This protocol outlines
an impact evaluation of DREAMS in four settings.
METHODS: To achieve an impact evaluation that is credible and timely, we describe
a mix of methods that build on longitudinal data available in existing
surveillance sites prior to DREAMS roll-out. In three long-running surveillance
sites (in rural and urban Kenya and rural South Africa), the evaluation will
measure: (1) population-level changes over time in HIV incidence and
socio-economic, behavioural and health outcomes among AGYW and young men (before,
during, after DREAMS); and (2) causal pathways linking uptake of DREAMS
interventions to 'mediators' of change such as empowerment, through to
behavioural and health outcomes, using nested cohort studies with samples of
~ 1000-1500 AGYW selected randomly from the general population and followed for
two years. In Zimbabwe, where DREAMS includes an offer of pre-exposure HIV
prophylaxis (PrEP), cohorts of young women who sell sex will be followed for two 
years to measure the impact of 'DREAMS+PrEP' on HIV incidence among young women
at highest risk of HIV. In all four settings, process evaluation and qualitative 
studies will monitor the delivery and context of DREAMS implementation. The
primary evaluation outcome is HIV incidence, and secondary outcomes include
indicators of sexual behavior change, and social and biological protection.
DISCUSSION: DREAMS is, to date, the most ambitious effort to scale-up
combinations or 'packages' of multi-sectoral interventions for HIV prevention.
Evidence of its effectiveness in reducing HIV incidence among AGYW, and
demonstrating which aspects of the lives of AGYW were changed, will offer
valuable lessons for replication.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), loss to
follow-up, and HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) are challenges to achieving UNAIDS'
targets of 90% of those diagnosed HIV-positive receiving treatment, and 90% of
those receiving treatment achieving viral suppression. In Kenya, the pediatric
population represents 8% of total HIV infections and pediatric virological
failure is estimated at 33%. The monitoring of early warning indicators (EWIs)
for HIVDR can help to identify and correct gaps in ART program functioning to
improve HIV care and treatment outcomes. However, EWIs have not been integrated
into health systems. We assessed challenges to the use of EWIs and solutions to
challenges identified by frontline health administrators.
METHODS: We conducted key informant interviews with health administrators who
were fully knowledgeable of the ART program at 23 pediatric ART sites in 18
counties across Kenya from May to June 2015. Thematic content analysis identified
themes for three EWIs: on-time pill pick-up, retention in care, and virological
suppression.
RESULTS: Nine themes-six at the facility level and three at the patient
level-emerged as major challenges to EWI monitoring. At the facility level,
themes centered on system issues (e.g., slow return of viral load results), staff
shortages and inadequate adherence counseling skills, lack of effective patient
tracking and linkage systems, and lack of support for health personnel. At the
patient level, themes focused on stigma, non-disclosure of HIV status to children
who are age eligible, and little engagement of guardians in the children's care. 
Practical solutions identified included the use of lay health workers (e.g., peer
educators, community health workers) to implement a variety of care and treatment
tasks, whole facility approaches to adherence counseling, adolescent peer support
groups, and working with children directly as soon as they are age eligible.
DISCUSSION: The monitoring of EWIs has not been routine in health facilities in
Kenya due to several challenges. However, facilities have implemented novel
strategies to address some of these barriers. Future work is needed to assess
whether scale-up of some of these approaches can aid in the effective use of EWIs
and improving HIV care outcomes among the pediatric population.

In April 2016, the Population Council, in partnership with the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the International Consortium for Emergency Contraception, 
convened a regional meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, geared toward supporting countries
in East and Southern Africa in meeting their obligations under the Maputo
Protocol. These obligations include expanding access to women's reproductive
health services - especially women survivors of sexual violence. Government and
civil society representatives from six countries participated: Botswana,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, and Zambia. Countries were selected based on to 
their being priority settings for the projects that sponsored the meeting,
coupled with the fact that they were each far enough along in addressing
post-rape care to be able to develop concrete policy, programming, and/or legal
action plans by the end of the meeting. The meeting was the first activity in a
joint project of technical assistance by the conveners, aimed at strengthening
access to comprehensive post-rape care for survivors of sexual violence. It aimed
to sensitize Member States to their obligations under the Maputo Protocol to
expand women's access to emergency contraception (EC) and safe abortion services,
and to inspire them to do so by providing information, research evidence, and a
platform for discussion. The meeting deliberations fostered a better
understanding of opportunities to broaden access to EC and safe abortion for
survivors in the region. Discussions on EC in this regard centered on
strengthening EC delivery in the clinical context, decentralizing EC services,
increasing community awareness, and overcoming policy barriers. Safe abortion
discussions focused primarily on legislation, policy, and integrating these
services into existing services for sexual violence survivors. Country-specific
action plans were developed to address gaps and weaknesses. The regional
technical meeting concluded with a discussion of practical steps that
participants could take to facilitate legal, policy, and program reform with
respect to pregnancy prevention and safe abortion in their respective countries. 
The steps revolved around three mainly areas, namely: establishing an evidence
base to inform action; creating forums for discussing the issues; and drafting
action points to carry the momentum from the meeting forward. This paper details 
the proceedings from this regional technical meeting - proceedings that are of
interest to the field of sexual and gender-based violence (and reproductive
health, more broadly) as challenges faced by countries in implementing the Maputo
Protocol are outlined, and evidence-informed and practice-based strategies for
addressing these challenges are provided.

BACKGROUND: Radiologically-confirmed pneumonia (RCP) is a specific end-point used
in trials of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) to estimate vaccine efficacy.
However, chest radiograph (CXR) interpretation varies within and between readers.
We measured the repeatability and reliability of paediatric CXR interpretation
using percent agreement and Cohen's Kappa and the validity of field readings
against expert review in a study of the impact of PCV on pneumonia.
METHODS: CXRs were obtained from 2716 children admitted between 2006 and 2014 to 
Kilifi County Hospital, Kilifi, Kenya, with clinically-defined severe or
very-severe pneumonia. Five clinicians and radiologists attended a three-day
training course on CXR interpretation using a WHO standard. All CXRs were read
once by two local primary readers. Discordant readings and 13% of concordant
readings were arbitrated by a panel of three expert radiologists. To assess
repeatability, a 5% median random sample was presented twice. Sensitivity and
specificity of the primary readers' interpretations was estimated against the
'gold-standard' of the arbitrators' results.
RESULTS: Of 2716 CXRs, 2 were uninterpretable and 159 were evaluated twice. The
percent agreement and Kappa for RCP were 89% and 0.68 and ranged between 84-97%
and 0.19-0.68, respectively, for all pathological findings. Intra-observer
repeatability was similar to inter-observer reliability. Sensitivities of the
primary readers to detect RCP were 69% and 73%; specificities were 96% and 95%.
CONCLUSION: Intra- and inter-observer agreements on interpretations of
radiologically-confirmed pneumonia are fair to good. Reasonable sensitivity and
high specificity make radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, determined in the
field, a suitable measure of relative vaccine effectiveness.

offered PrEP. PrEP offer to all women in high prevalence regions would result in 
26%.

BACKGROUND: Reproductive health knowledge is vital in the growth and development 
of young people and this impact greatly on their educational and personal outcome
as they proceed to adulthood. There has been an increasing occurrence of sexually
transmitted infections in institutions of higher learning. The study sought out
the strategies used by university students to prevent unplanned pregnancy and
determined their knowledge of contraception methods and sexually transmitted
infections in Mount Kenya University, main campus.
METHODS: Stratified sampling was employed. After a signed consent was obtained, a
self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were explored,
analyzed and percentages used to quantify the level of knowledge. Pearson's
chi-square was used to measure associations between categorical variables and
independent t-test used to measure the means and relationships of continuous
variables.
RESULTS: Condom use was established as the most prevalent strategy in prevention 
of unplanned pregnancy at 48.5 and 46.4% in prevention of STI and HIV/AIDS.
Almost two thirds (58%) of respondents reported that they were conversant with
only one method of contraception, 60% had knowledge of more than two types of
STIs, and 62.4% indicated that they were conversant with only hospitals as
facilities providing reproductive health services.
CONCLUSION: Young people in college require educational initiatives to sensitize 
them on STI, methods of contraception and positive social behaviors. There is
need to improve the accessibility of reproductive health services through
strengthening of services provided at campus health clinics.

The main hosts of the melon fly Zeugodacus cucurbitate are cultivated and wild
cucurbitaceous plants. In eastern Africa, the melon fly is a major pest of the
Solanaceae plant Solanum lycopersicum (tomato). We hypothesized that shared
species-specific volatiles may play a role in host attraction. We tested this
hypothesis by comparing the olfactory responses of the melon fly to Cucumis
sativus (cucumber) (Cucurbitaceae) and tomato plant odors in behavioral and
electrophysiological assays, followed by chemical analysis to identify the key
compounds mediating the interactions. Our results identified 13 shared components
between cucumber and tomato plant odors. A synthetic blend of seven of the shared
components dominated by monoterpenes at concentrations mimicking the volatile
bouquet of cucumber and tomato attracted both sexes of the melon fly. Our results
suggest that the presence and quantity of specific compounds in host odors are
the main predictors for host recognition in Z. cucurbitate.

The aim of the current analysis is to elucidate the link between childhood
experiences of violence and physical intimate partner violence in young adulthood
in a national survey of young Kenyan women. In 2010, we conducted the Violence
against Children Survey in Kenya, collecting retrospective reports from 13 to
24 year old males and females (N = 2928). The analysis presented here focused on 
females aged 18-24 who ever had an intimate partner (n = 566). Young Kenyan women
had statistically higher odds of experiencing physical intimate partner violence 
(IPV) in young adulthood if they had experienced any childhood violence
(including sexual, emotional, or physical) [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.1 CI:
1.2-7.9, p = 0.02)], any childhood sexual violence (AOR = 2.5, CI 1.3-4.9,
p = 0.006), or unwanted completed sex (including pressured or forced sex prior to
age 18) (AOR = 4.3, CI: 2.3-8.3, p < 0.0001). Exposure to two (AOR = 3.9, CI:
1.2-12.2, p = 0.02) or three (AOR = 5.0, CI: 1.4-18.1, p = 0.01) types of
violence in childhood was also associated with a significantly higher odds of
experiencing adult physical IPV. Childhood violence is associated with increased 
odds of adult physical IPV among young women; efforts to prevent violence against
children and provide appropriate care and support to adult survivors are critical
to interrupt this cycle of violence.

Data on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in adults
from low-income, high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence African
settings are scarce. We conducted adult SARI surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi.
From January 2011 to December 2013, individuals aged ≥ 15 years with SARI (both
inpatients and outpatients) were enrolled at a large teaching hospital in
Blantyre, Malawi. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for influenza and other
respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We estimated hospital-attended 
influenza-positive SARI incidence rates and assessed factors associated with
influenza positivity and clinical severity (Modified Early Warning Score > 4). We
enrolled 1,126 SARI cases; 163 (14.5%) were positive for influenza. Human
immunodeficiency virus prevalence was 50.3%. Annual incidence of
hospital-attended influenza-associated SARI was 9.7-16.8 cases per 100,000
population. Human immunodeficiency virus was associated with a 5-fold greater
incidence (incidence rate ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.83-6.32).
On multivariable analysis, female gender, as well as recruitment in hot, rainy
season (December to March; adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57-5.06)
and cool, dry season (April to August; aOR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.35-4.15), was
associated with influenza positivity, whereas influenza-positive patients were
less likely to be HIV-infected (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43-0.80) or have viral
coinfection (aOR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.36-0.73). Human immunodeficiency virus
infection (aOR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.35-2.56) and recruitment in hot, rainy season
(aOR: 4.98, 95% CI: 3.17-7.81) were independently associated with clinical
severity. In this high HIV prevalence population, influenza was associated with
nearly 15% of hospital-attended SARI. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is
an important risk factor for clinical severity in all-cause and
influenza-associated SARI. Expanded access to HIV testing and antiretroviral
treatment, as well as targeted influenza vaccination, may reduce the burden of
SARI in Malawi and other high HIV prevalence settings.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 15-year impact of the work/study nursing
upgrading programme in East Africa.
BACKGROUND: Working nurses in Africa are often primary family income earners,
with limited ability to leave jobs and upgrade qualifications. In 2001, the
university established a work/study upgrade programme for enrolled- and
diploma-level nurses, allowing them to upgrade their qualifications while
continuing to work and support families. Donor partnerships provided scholarships
to further increase programme access.
DESIGN: A mixed-method design was used involving an online alumni survey and 24
interviews and 23 focus groups with 172 purposively selected representatives of
nursing graduates, employers, regulatory bodies, professional associations and
senior nursing officials.
METHOD: Quantitative data were analysed using frequencies and percentages.
Inductive thematic analysis was used for qualitative data. Equator guidelines
informed reporting of both qualitative and quantitative results.
RESULTS: Of the 549 graduates who completed the survey, 81.2% (n = 446) were
female, 93.1% were currently employed and 98% worked within East Africa. They
reported improved professional competence (69.4%), nursing practice (25.9%) and
patient outcomes (4.6%) on graduation. Extracted themes included the following:
flexible/accessible programme; friendly learning environment; effective teaching 
and learning strategies; acquisition of nursing knowledge, skills and
competencies; stakeholders' role in the programme; career/professional
advancement; and strengthened health systems.
CONCLUSION: The work/study programme was an effective nursing workforce capacity 
development strategy. Programme access was strengthened via the supporting donor 
partnership. Positive outcomes were achieved with respect to the university's
values of quality, access, relevance and impact.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Long-term sustainable development of nurses and
midwives is fundamental to achieving sustainable development goals. Work/study
programmes and private-public partnerships are effective mechanisms to strengthen
the development of nursing and the overall healthcare workforce in low-resource
settings.

Sweet potato is a major food security crop within sub-Saharan Africa where 90% of
Africa production occurs. One of the major limitations of sweet potato production
are viral infections. In this study, we used a combination of whole genome
sequences from a field isolate obtained from Kenya and those available in
GenBank. Sequences of four sweet potato viruses: Sweet potato feathery mottle
virus (SPFMV), Sweet potato virus C (SPVC), Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus
(SPCSV), Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV) were obtained from the Kenyan
sample. SPFMV sequences both from this study and from GenBank were found to be
recombinant. Recombination breakpoints were found within the Nla-Pro, coat
protein and P1 genes. The SPCSV, SPVC, and SPCFV viruses from this study were
non-recombinant. Bayesian phylogenomic relationships across whole genome trees
showed variation in the number of well-supported clades; within SPCSV (RNA1 and
RNA2) and SPFMV two well-supported clades (I and II) were resolved. The SPCFV
tree resolved three well-supported clades (I-III) while four well-supported
clades were resolved in SPVC (I-IV). Similar clades were resolved within the
coalescent species trees. However, there were disagreements between the clades
resolved in the gene trees compared to those from the whole genome tree and
coalescent species trees. However the coat protein gene tree of SPCSV and SPCFV
resolved similar clades to the genome and coalescent species tree while this was 
not the case in SPFMV and SPVC. In addition, we report variation in selective
pressure within sites of individual genes across all four viruses; overall all
viruses were under purifying selection. We report the first complete genomes of
SPFMV, SPVC, SPCFV, and a partial SPCSV from Kenya as a mixed infection in one
sample. Our findings provide a snap shot on the evolutionary relationship of
sweet potato viruses (SPFMV, SPVC, SPCFV, and SPCSV) from Kenya as well as
assessing whether selection pressure has an effect on their evolution.

Background: The prevalence of common mental disorders increases in humanitarian
emergencies while access to services to address them decreases. Problem
Management Plus (PM+) is a brief five-session trans-diagnostic psychological WHO 
intervention employing empirically supported strategies that can be delivered by 
non-specialist lay-providers under specialist supervision to adults impaired by
distress. Two recent randomized controlled trials in Pakistan and Kenya
demonstrated the efficacy of individually delivered PM+. To make PM+ more
scalable and acceptable in different contexts, it is important to develop a group
version as well, with 6-8 participants in session. A study is needed to
demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of both the intervention in a new
cultural context and the procedures to evaluate Group PM+ in a cluster randomized
controlled trial.
Methods: This protocol describes a feasibility trial to Group PM+ in Sindhuli,
Nepal. This study will evaluate procedures for a cluster randomized controlled
trial (c-RCT) with Village Development Committees (VDCs), which are the second
smallest unit of government administration, as the unit of randomization. Adults 
with high levels of psychological distress and functional impairment will receive
either Group PM+ (n = 60) or enhanced usual care (EUC; n = 60). Psychological
distress, functional impairment, depression symptoms, posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and perceived problems will be measured during
screening, pre-treatment baseline, and 7-10 days after the intervention.
Qualitative data will be collected from beneficiaries, their families, local
stakeholders, and staff to support quantitative data and to identify themes
reporting that those involved and/or effected by Group PM+ perceived it as being 
acceptable, feasible, and useful. The primary objective of this trial is to
evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention; to identify
issues around implementation of local adaptation methods, training, supervision, 
and outcomes measures; and to assure that procedures are adequate for a
subsequent effectiveness c-RCT.
Discussion: Outcomes from this trial will contribute to optimizing feasibility
and acceptability through cultural adaptation and contextualization of the
intervention as well as refining the design for a c-RCT, which will evaluate the 
effectiveness of Group PM+ in Nepal.

Natural and anthropogenic drivers of cub recruitment in a large carnivore.

Recruitment is a critical parameter governing population dynamics and influences 
population persistence. Understanding the drivers of recruitment is therefore
important for conservation, especially for long-lived mammals such as large
carnivores, which have low reproductive rates, rendering them prone to
extinction. Using cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) as a model species, I investigated 
the variation in cub recruitment in relation to habitat and the abundance of
tourists and predators. Per litter, female cheetahs on average raised 1.71 ± 1.35
cubs to independence, but this varied depending on the presence of open habitat
and the abundance of tourists, both of which had a negative effect on cub
recruitment. More specifically, female cheetahs that were mostly found in open
habitats on average raised 1.69 ± 0.14 cubs per litter to independence compared
to 3.04 ± 0.26 cubs in denser habitat. Similarly, female cheetahs that were
exposed to high tourist abundance on average raised 0.21 ± 0.72 cubs to
independence compared to 2.32 ± 0.11 cubs in low tourism areas. Neither lion nor 
spotted hyaena abundance had an impact on the number of cubs that were recruited.
Based on these findings, I recommend that the importance of a heterogeneous
environment should be taken into consideration in habitat management, restoration
efforts, and reintroduction programs. In addition, tourist quotas should be put
in place in high visitation areas and strict wildlife viewing guidelines, such as
number of vehicles, tourist behavior, time spent, and distance to a sighting,
should be enforced. Cub recruitment is an important component of species
persistence and incorporating these findings could aid conservation efforts for
species that are increasingly under threat.

Fish has been an important source of proteins, essential vitamins, and low
saturated fats for centuries. However, improperly handled fish can expose
consumers to infectious bacteria, including difficult to treat
multidrug-resistant pathogens. With the goal to investigate the existence of
disease-causing and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, we examined bacterial
communities present on various types of fish purchased from supermarkets in
Houston, Texas, USA. The bacterial communities were characterized by selective
phenotypic culture methods, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, and antibiotic
susceptibility testing. The results revealed the presence of different bacterial 
communities on the fish samples examined. The bacterial communities were not
significantly different between the supermarkets sampled. The following
presumptive human pathogens were isolated on the fish samples: Escherichia coli
(67%), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (31%), Shigella and Salmonella species (28%),
Listeria species (29%), and Staphylococcus aureus (28%). Drug sensitivity assays 
showed resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics ciprofloxacin, gentamicin,
and vancomycin. Out of a total of 99 E. coli samples tested, 41.4% were resistant
to ciprofloxacin, whereas 33.3% were resistant to gentamicin. Of the total of 31 
S. aureus isolates tested, 87% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, whereas 61.3%
were resistant to vancomycin. Moreover, some of the E. coli strains were
resistant to both ciprofloxacin and gentamicin (28%), whereas 49% of the S.
aureus isolates were resistant to both ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. These
results highlight the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant foodborne pathogens
on fish purchased from the supermarkets and underscore the risk associated with
improper handling of fish.

Viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) predisposes to bacterial pneumonia
possibly by facilitating growth of bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae
colonising the nasopharynx. We investigated whether viral URTI is temporally
associated with an increase in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration.
Episodes of symptomatic RSV or rhinovirus URTI among children <5 years were
identified from a longitudinal household study in rural Kenya. lytA and alu PCR
were performed on nasopharyngeal samples collected twice-weekly, to measure the
pneumococcal concentration adjusted for the concentration of human DNA present.
Pneumococcal concentration increased with a fold-change of 3.80 (95%CI
1.95-7.40), with acquisition of RSV or rhinovirus, during 51 URTI episodes among 
42 children. In repeated swabs from the baseline period, in the two weeks before 
URTI developed, within-episode variation was broad; within +/-112-fold range of
the geometric mean. We observed only a small increase in nasopharyngeal
pneumococcal concentration during RSV or rhinovirus URTI, relative to natural
variation. Other factors, such as host response to viral infection, may be more
important than nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration in determining risk of
invasive disease.

INTRODUCTION: In many African countries, including Kenya, a major barrier to
achieving child survival goals is the slow decline in neonatal mortality that now
represents 45% of the under-5 mortality. In newborn care, nurses are the primary 
caregivers in newborn settings and are essential in the delivery of safe and
effective care. However, due to high patient workloads and limited resources,
nurses may often consciously or unconsciously prioritise the care they provide
resulting in some tasks being left undone or partially done (missed care). Missed
care has been associated with poor patient outcomes in high-income countries.
However, missed care, examined by direct observation, has not previously been the
subject of research in low/middle-income countries.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim of this study is to quantify essential neonatal
nursing care provided to newborns within newborn units. We will undertake a
cross-sectional study using direct observational methods within newborn units in 
six health facilities in Nairobi City County across the public,
private-for-profit and private-not-for-profit sectors. A total of 216 newborns
will be observed between 1 September 2017 and 30 May 2018. Stratified random
sampling will be used to select random 12-hour observation periods while
purposive sampling will be used to identify newborns for direct observation. We
will report the overall prevalence of care left undone, the common tasks that are
left undone and describe any sharing of tasks with people not formally qualified 
to provide care.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study has been granted by the
Kenya Medical Research Institute Scientific and Ethics Review Unit. Written
informed consent will be sought from mothers and nurses. Findings from this work 
will be shared with the participating hospitals, an expert advisory group that
comprises members involved in policy-making and more widely to the international 
community through conferences and peer-reviewed journals.

Many gaps in care exist for provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in
sub-Saharan Africa. Differentiated HIV care tailors provision of ART for patients
based on their level of acuity, providing alternatives for where, by whom, and
how often care occurs. We conducted a scoping review to assess novel
differentiated care models for ART provision for stable HIV-infected adults in
sub-Saharan Africa, and how these models can be used to guide differentiated care
implementation in Kenya. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, 
Web of Science, Popline, Cochrane Library, and African Index Medicus between
January 2006 and January 2017. Grey literature searches and handsearching were
also used. We included articles that quantitatively assessed the health,
acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of differentiated HIV care. Two reviewers
independently performed article screening, data extraction and determination of
inclusion for analysis. We included 40 publications involving over 240,000
participants spanning nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa - 54.4% evaluated
clinical outcomes, 23.5% evaluated acceptability outcomes, and 22.1% evaluated
cost outcomes. Differentiated care models included: facility fast-track drug
refills and appointment spacing, facility or community-based ART groups,
community ART distribution points or home-based care, and task-shifting or
decentralization of care. Studies suggest that these approaches had similar
outcomes in viral load suppression and retention in care and were acceptable
alternatives to standard HIV care. No clear results could be inferred for studies
investigating task shifting and those reporting cost-effectiveness outcomes.
Kenya has started to scale up differentiated care models, but further evaluation,
quality improvement and research studies should be performed as different models 
are rolled out.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based nutrition programs depend on accurate estimates of
malnutrition derived from data collected in population representative surveys.
The feasibility of obtaining accurate anthropometric data as part of national,
multisectoral surveys has been a debated issue.
OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate changes in anthropometric data quality
corresponding to investments by the Kenya Ministry of Health and nutrition sector
partners for the 2014 Kenya Demographic Health Survey.
METHODS: Anthropometric data collected during the 2008 to 2009 and 2014 Kenya
surveys were reanalyzed to assess standard parameters of quality: standard
deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of z-score values for 3 anthropometric
indicators (weight for height, height for age, and weight for age), percentage of
children with missing measurements and outlier values, digit preference, and
heaping of age.
RESULTS: A total of 9936 households were selected in 2008 to 2009, and 39 679
households were selected in 2014. Standard deviation of z-scores for all 3
indicators was smaller in 2014 than in 2008 to 2009. Applying original
Demographic and Health Survey exclusion criteria, weight for height z-scores were
1.16 in 2014, 10.1% narrower than 2008 to 2009. The percentage of outlying values
declined significantly from 2008 to 2009 to 2014 for both height for age and
weight for height ( P < .001). Digit preference scores in 2014 improved for both 
weight ( P = .011) and height ( P < .001) suggesting less rounding of terminal
digits.
CONCLUSIONS: All tests of data quality suggest an improvement in 2014 relative to
2008 to 2009, despite the complexity implied by the larger sample. This
improvement corresponds with efforts to enhance training and supervision of
anthropometry, suggesting a positive effect of these enhancements.

Plant parasitic nematode infection of crops can be highly detrimental to
agricultural production. Since the discovery that plant roots release chemicals
that attract the infective stage of plant parasitic nematodes some 80 years ago, 
significant progress in identifying the signaling molecules has occurred only
relatively recently. Here, we review the literature on chemical ecological
studies of two major plant parasitic nematode groups: root knot nematodes in the 
genus Meloidogyne and cyst nematodes in the genus Globodera because of the
negative impact their parasitism has on farming systems in Africa. We then
highlight perspectives for future directions for their management.

BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus that causes
severe disease in livestock and humans. The virus has caused recurrent outbreaks 
in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula since its discovery in 1931. This review
sought to evaluate RVFV seroprevalence across the African continent in livestock,
wildlife and humans in order to understand the spatio-temporal distribution of
RVFV seroprevalence and to identify knowledge gaps and areas requiring further
research. Risk factors associated with seropositivity were identified and study
designs evaluated to understand the validity of their results.
METHODOLOGY: The Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to produce a protocol to
systematically search for RVFV seroprevalence studies in PubMed and Web of
Science databases. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) statement guided the evaluation of study design and
analyses.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 174 RVFV seroprevalence studies in 126 articles
fulfilled the inclusion criteria. RVFV seroprevalence was recorded in 31 African 
countries from 1968 to 2016 and varied by time, species and country. RVFV
seroprevalence articles including either livestock and humans or livestock and
wildlife seroprevalence records were limited in number (8/126). No articles
considered wildlife, livestock and human seroprevalence concurrently, nor
wildlife and humans alone. Many studies did not account for study design bias or 
the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on conducting seroprevalence studies at
the wildlife, livestock and human interface to better understand the nature of
cross-species transmission of RVFV. Reporting should be more transparent and
biases accounted for in future seroprevalence research to understand the true
burden of disease on the African continent.

To optimize scale-up of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for pregnant women at risk
of HIV in high HIV burden settings, implementation strategies must be developed
that account for perceptions of PrEP in this unique population. Semistructured
focus group discussions were conducted with 68 HIV-uninfected Kenyan pregnant and
postpartum women without prior PrEP knowledge or experience. A qualitative
descriptive analysis was performed, using a constant comparison approach, to
identify key themes related to the values and rationale impacting potential PrEP 
use in pregnancy. Median age was 19.5 years and participants were either pregnant
or had 1-2 children. Almost all (96%) were married or had a steady partner. Women
felt pregnancy was a time of high HIV risk because they desired sex less
frequently, which may lead their partners to have outside partnerships. This made
PrEP an attractive HIV prevention option for themselves and their infants.
Although women believed male partner behaviors influenced their HIV risk, many
women perceived that male partners would react negatively, including becoming
physically violent, if they discovered that women used PrEP. Clinicians were
identified as potential facilitators of PrEP use who could explain PrEP to male
partners on behalf of pregnant women. Women said that community-level stigma
against HIV and potential for conflating PrEP with antiretroviral therapy (ART)
would necessitate that PrEP use be discreet. Our results indicate the importance 
of addressing risk perception of women, concerns of male partners, HIV stigma,
and benefits of PrEP for HIV prevention as programs are developed for pregnant
women.

INTRODUCTION: Key population (KP) members frequently experience violence that
violates their human rights, increases their risk of HIV, and acts as a barrier
to access and uptake of HIV services. To be effective, HIV programmes for members
of KPs need to prevent and respond to violence against them. We describe a
violence prevention and response strategy led by the national KP programme in
Kenya and examine trends in reports of and responses to violence (provision of
support to an individual who reports violence within 24 hours of receiving the
report).
METHODS: Quarterly programme monitoring data on the number of reports of violence
and the number of responses to violence from 81 implementing partners between
October 2013 and September 2017 were aggregated annually and analysed using
simple trend analysis. Reports of violence relative to KP members reached,
expressed as a percentage, and the percentage of reports of violence that
received a response were also examined.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Between 2013 and 2017, annual reports of violence
increased from 4171 to 13,496 cases among female sex workers (FSWs), 910 to 1122 
cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) and 121 to 873 cases among people who
inject drugs (PWID). Reports of violence relative to KP members reached increased
among FSWs (6.2% to 9.7%; p < 0.001) and PWID (2.1% to 6.0%; p < 0.001) and
decreased among MSM (10.0% to 4.2%; p < 0.001). During the same period, timely
responses to reports of violence increased from 53% to 84% (p < 0.001) among
FSWs, 44% to 80% (p < 0.001) among MSM and 37% to 97% (p < 0.001) among PWID.
CONCLUSIONS: Over the past four years in Kenya, there has been an increase in
violence reporting among FSWs and PWID and an increase in violence response among
all KPs. This case study demonstrates that violence against KP members can be
effectively addressed under the leadership of the national government, even in an
environment where KP members' behaviours are criminalized. Creating an enabling
environment to promote wellbeing and safety for KP members is a critical enabler 
for HIV prevention programmes to achieve 95-95-95 goals.

Social influences on survival and reproduction: Insights from a long-term study

For social species, the environment has two components: physical and social. The 
social environment modifies the individual's interaction with the physical
environment, and the physical environment may in turn impact individuals' social 
relationships. This interplay can generate considerable variation among
individuals in survival and reproduction. Here, I synthesize more than four
decades of research on the baboons of the Amboseli basin in southern Kenya to
illustrate how social and physical environments interact to affect reproduction
and survival. For immature baboons, social behaviour can both mitigate and
exacerbate the challenge of survival. Only c. 50% of live-born females and c. 44%
of live-born males reach the median age of first reproduction. Variation in
pre-adult survival, growth and development is associated with multiple aspects of
the social environment. For instance, conspecifics provide direct care and are a 
major source of social knowledge about food and the environment, but conspecifics
can also represent a direct threat to survival through infanticide. In adulthood,
both competition (within and between social groups) and cooperative affiliation
(i.e. collective action and/or the exchange of social resources such as grooming)
are prominent features of baboon social life and have important consequences for 
reproduction and survival. For instance, adult females with higher social
dominance ranks have accelerated reproduction, and adult females that engage in
more frequent affiliative social interactions have higher survival throughout
adulthood. The early life environment also has important consequences for adult
reproduction and survival, as in a number of other bird and mammal species. In
seasonal breeders, early life effects often apply to entire cohorts; in contrast,
in nonseasonal and highly social species such as baboons, early life effects are 
more individual-specific, stemming from considerable variation not only in the
early physical environment (even if they are born in the same year) but also in
the particulars of their social environment.

BACKGROUND: Human genetic factors are important determinants of malaria risk. We 
investigated associations between multiple candidate polymorphisms-many related
to the structure or function of red blood cells-and risk for severe Plasmodium
falciparum malaria and its specific phenotypes, including cerebral malaria,
severe malaria anaemia, and respiratory distress.
METHODS: We did a case-control study in Kilifi County, Kenya. We recruited as
cases children presenting with severe malaria to the high-dependency ward of
Kilifi County Hospital. We included as controls infants born in the local
community between Aug 1, 2006, and Sept 30, 2010, who were part of a genetics
study. We tested for associations between a range of candidate malaria-protective
genes and risk for severe malaria and its specific phenotypes. We used a
permutation approach to account for multiple comparisons between polymorphisms
and severe malaria. We judged p values less than 0·005 significant for the
primary analysis of the association between candidate genes and severe malaria.
FINDINGS: Between June 11, 1995, and June 12, 2008, 2244 children with severe
malaria were recruited to the study, and 3949 infants were included as controls. 
Overall, 263 (12%) of 2244 children with severe malaria died in hospital,
including 196 (16%) of 1233 with cerebral malaria. We investigated 121
polymorphisms in 70 candidate severe malaria-associated genes. We found
significant associations between risk for severe malaria overall and
polymorphisms in 15 genes or locations, of which most were related to red blood
cells: ABO, ATP2B4, ARL14, CD40LG, FREM3, INPP4B, G6PD, HBA (both HBA1 and HBA2),
HBB, IL10, LPHN2 (also known as ADGRL2), LOC727982, RPS6KL1, CAND1, and GNAS.
Combined, these genetic associations accounted for 5·2% of the variance in risk
for developing severe malaria among individuals in the general population. We
confirmed established associations between severe malaria and sickle-cell trait
(odds ratio [OR] 0·15, 95% CI 0·11-0·20; p=2·61 × 10-58), blood group O (0·74,
0·66-0·82; p=6·26 × 10-8), and -α3·7-thalassaemia (0·83, 0·76-0·90;
p=2·06 × 10-6). We also found strong associations between overall risk of severe 
malaria and polymorphisms in both ATP2B4 (OR 0·76, 95% CI 0·63-0·92; p=0·001) and
FREM3 (0·64, 0·53-0·79; p=3·18 × 10-14). The association with FREM3 could be
accounted for by linkage disequilibrium with a complex structural mutation within
the glycophorin gene region (comprising GYPA, GYPB, and GYPE) that encodes for
the rare Dantu blood group antigen. Heterozygosity for Dantu was associated with 
risk for severe malaria (OR 0·57, 95% CI 0·49-0·68; p=3·22 × 10-11), as was
homozygosity (0·26, 0·11-0·62; p=0·002).
INTERPRETATION: Both ATP2B4 and the Dantu blood group antigen are associated with
the structure and function of red blood cells. ATP2B4 codes for plasma membrane
calcium-transporting ATPase 4 (the major calcium pump on red blood cells) and the
glycophorins are ligands for parasites to invade red blood cells. Future work
should aim at uncovering the mechanisms by which these polymorphisms can result
in severe malaria protection and investigate the implications of these
associations for wider health.

To protect women against cervical cancer, the World Health Organization
recommends that women aged 30 to 49 years be screened with tests that detect
human papillomavirus (HPV). If the countries that have the greatest burden of
this disease-especially those in sub-Saharan Africa-are not to be left behind, we
must understand the challenges they face and identify measures that can help them
take full advantage now of innovations that are transforming screening services
in wealthier countries. We reviewed policy documents and published literature
related to Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, and met with key personnel from
government and nongovernmental organizations. National policy makers understand
the value of HPV testing in terms of its superior sensitivity and the
programmatic advantages that could result from using self-collected samples.
However, while these countries have national cervical cancer prevention
strategies, and some have national departments or units for cervical cancer
prevention, screening is rare, funding scarce, and quality low. Age guidelines
are not strictly followed, with scarce resources being used to screen many women 
younger than the recommended ages. Published evidence of the benefits of HPV
testing-including performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness-must be provided to
ministry of health leaders, along with information on anticipated costs for
training personnel, purchasing supplies, providing facility space, and
maintaining test kits. Despite the obstacles, a joint effort on the part of
global and national stakeholders to introduce molecular screening methods can
bring better protection to the women who need it most.

BACKGROUND: Children initially hospitalized with severe anaemia in Africa are at 
high risk of readmission or death within 6 months after discharge. No
intervention strategy specifically protects children during the post-discharge
period. Recent evidence from Malawi shows that 3 months of post-discharge malaria
chemoprevention (PMC) with monthly treatment with artemether-lumefantrine in
children with severe malarial anaemia prevented 31% of deaths and readmissions.
While a confirmatory multi-centre trial for PMC with
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is on going in Kenya and Uganda, there is a need
to design and evaluate an effective delivery strategy for this promising
intervention.
METHODS: This is a cluster-randomized trial with 5 arms, each representing a
unique PMC delivery strategy. Convalescent children aged less than 5 years and
weighing more than 5 kg admitted with severe anaemia and clinically stable are
included. All eligible children will receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine at 2,
6 and 10 weeks after discharge either: 1) in the community without an SMS
reminder; 2) in the community with an SMS reminder; 3) in the community with a
community health worker reminder; 4) at the hospital with an SMS reminder; or 5) 
at the hospital without an SMS reminder. For community-based strategies (1, 2 and
3), mothers will be given all the PMC doses at the time of discharge while for
hospital-based strategies (4 and 5) mothers will be required to visit the
hospital each month. Each arm will consist of 25 clusters with an average of 3
children per cluster giving approximately 75 children and will be followed up for
15 weeks. The primary outcome measure is uptake of complete courses of PMC drugs.
DISCUSSION: The proposed study will help to identify the most effective,
cost-effective, acceptable and feasible strategy for delivering malaria
chemoprevention for post-discharge management of severe anaemia in under-five
children in the Malawian context. This information is important for policy
decision in the quest for new strategies for malaria control in children in
similar contexts.

A crucial aspect in climate change is to understand how an ecosystem will adapt
under different environmental conditions and how it will influence the ecological
resources and the connected human activities. In this study, a numerical model
reproduces the growth dynamics, dispersion and settlement of clam's larvae in the
Venice lagoon. On the basis of the last IPCC scenarios for the years 2050 and
2100, the model simulates the changes in larval settlement, showing how the
geographical distribution and, consequently, the nursery area changes over time. 
Our results indicate that climate change will modify, not only the timing of the 
settlements (from spring-summer to winter autumn) and the spatial distribution of
nursery areas (from central to southern lagoon), but also the absolute quantity
of settled larvae in the lagoon. This can strongly affect aquaculture in terms of
availability of seed and farming practice. Given that these changes are due to
the variations in temperature and circulation, similar processes are likely to
happen in other transitional environments all over the world affecting the global
aquaculture resources. In this regard, the tool we developed could support local 
policymakers in the knowledge-based planning and sustainable management of clam
aquaculture in vulnerable environments.

BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV, syphilis, malaria and anaemia are leading
preventable causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In Kenya, policy states women
should be tested for all four conditions (malaria only if febrile) at first
antenatal care (ANC) visit. In practice, while HIV screening is conducted,
coverage of screening for the others is suboptimal and early pregnancy management
of illnesses is compromised. This is particularly evident at rural dispensaries
that lack laboratories and have parallel programmes for HIV, reproductive health 
and malaria, resulting in fractured and inadequate care for women.
METHODS: A longitudinal eight-month implementation study integrating
point-of-care diagnostic tests for the four conditions into routine ANC was
conducted in seven purposively selected dispensaries in western Kenya. Testing
proficiency of healthcare workers was observed at initial training and at three
monthly intervals thereafter. Adoption of testing was compared using ANC register
data 8.5 months before and eight months during the intervention. Fidelity to
clinical management guidelines was determined by client exit interviews with
success defined as ≥90% adherence.
FINDINGS: For first ANC visits at baseline (n = 529), testing rates were
unavailable for malaria, low for syphilis (4.3%) and anaemia (27.8%), and near
universal for HIV (99%). During intervention, over 95% of first attendees (n =
586) completed four tests and of those tested positive, 70.6% received penicillin
or erythromycin for syphilis, 65.5% and 48.3% received cotrimoxazole and
antiretrovirals respectively for HIV, and 76.4% received artemether/lumefantrine,
quinine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine correctly for malaria. Iron and folic
supplements were given to nearly 90% of women but often at incorrect doses.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating point-of-care testing into ANC at dispensaries with
established HIV testing programmes resulted in a significant increase in testing 
rates, without disturbing HIV testing rates. While more cases were detected and
treated, treatment fidelity still requires strengthening and an integrated
monitoring and evaluation system needs to be established.

The effect of a targeted training intervention on uptake of recommended hygiene
practices by caregivers of children 6-23 months was assessed. A sub-sample of 40 
mothers from 303 households was used for a detailed study of hygiene practices
during preparation of complementary foods after training. Mothers and caregivers 
were observed for 6 months and evaluated using a questionnaire. Data were
analyzed using SPSS and Chi-square test was used to determine the differences in 
proportions of mothers and caregivers who adopted recommended practices. Results 
showed significant increase in the proportions of mothers and caregivers who
followed recommended hygiene practices after training. There was significant
decrease in prevalence of diarrhea among the children (45% to 8.6%). It can be
concluded that targeted training on practical hands-on activities such as hand
washing, cleaning of cooking and serving utensils, covering of food and water
increase adoption of recommended hygiene and sanitation practices.

Inadequate menstrual hygiene presents a barrier to women's dignity and health.
Recent attention to this marginalised challenge has resulted in the first
national assessments of menstrual practices. Intuitively, surveys require women
to have had a recent menses to be eligible. This study seeks to determine if
there are demographic differences between women who are eligible and ineligible
to answer questions about their menstrual hygiene during these assessments.
Secondary analyses were undertaken on nationally or state representative data
collected by the Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 survey programme 
across eight countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger,
Nigeria, and Uganda). Female respondents were included in the study and compared 
on whether they had a menstrual period within the past three months and thus were
eligible to answer questions regarding menstrual practices. On average, 29% of
surveyed women across samples were ineligible to be asked menstrual hygiene
questions. Higher levels of education, wealth, and urban residence were
associated with higher odds of eligibility. Young and unmarried women were also
more likely to be eligible. Demographic differences between eligible and
ineligible women were consistent across all countries. Wealthy, urban, and
educated women are more likely to be eligible to answer survey questions about
menstrual hygiene. While population surveys may be representative of menstruating
women, proportions of menstrual hygiene practices reported underrepresent the
experiences of more vulnerable groups. These groups are likely to have greater
struggles with menstrual hygiene when they are menstruating.

Despite evidence suggesting women are disproportionately affected by the lack of 
adequate and safe sanitation facilities around the world, there is limited
information about the factors that influence women's ability to access and
utilize sanitation, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of this study
was to explore factors influencing women's sanitation practices in informal
settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Information from 55 in-depth interviews conducted 
in 2016 with 55 women in Mathare Valley Informal Settlement in Nairobi was used
to carry out cross-case, thematic analysis of women's common sanitation routines.
Women identified neighborhood disorganization, fear of victimization, lack of
privacy, and cleanliness/dirtiness of facilities as important factors in the
choices they make about their sanitation practices. This suggests that future
sanitation-related interventions and policies may need to consider strategies
that focus not only on toilet provision or adoption but also on issues of space
and community dynamics.

INTRODUCTION: There are significant knowledge gaps concerning complex forms of
mobility emergent in sub-Saharan Africa, their relationship to sexual behaviours,
HIV transmission, and how sex modifies these associations. This study, within an 
ongoing test-and-treat trial (SEARCH, NCT01864603), sought to measure effects of 
diverse metrics of mobility on behaviours, with attention to gender.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected in 2016 from 1919 adults in 12
communities in Kenya and Uganda, to examine mobility (labour/non-labour-related
travel), migration (changes of residence over geopolitical boundaries) and their 
associations with sexual behaviours (concurrent/higher risk partnerships), by
region and sex. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models, stratified
by sex and adjusted for clustering by community, were fitted to examine
associations of mobility with higher-risk behaviours, in past 2 years/past
6 months, controlling for key covariates.
RESULTS: The population was 45.8% male and 52.4% female, with mean age 38.7
(median 37, IQR: 17); 11.2% had migrated in the past 2 years. Migration varied by
region (14.4% in Kenya, 11.5% in southwestern and 1.7% in eastern and Uganda) and
sex (13.6% of men and 9.2% of women). Ten per cent reported labour-related travel
and 45.9% non-labour-related travel in past 6 months-and varied by region and
sex: labour-related mobility was more common in men (18.5%) than women (2.9%);
non-labour-related mobility was more common in women (57.1%) than men (32.6%). In
2015 to 2016, 24.6% of men and 6.6% of women had concurrent sexual partnerships; 
in past 6 months, 21.6% of men and 5.4% of women had concurrent partnerships.
Concurrency in 2015 to 2016 was more strongly associated with migration in women 
[aRR = 2.0, 95% CI(1.1 to 3.7)] than men [aRR = 1.5, 95% CI(1.0 to 2.2)].
Concurrency in past 6 months was more strongly associated with labour-related
mobility in women [aRR = 2.9, 95% CI(1.0 to 8.0)] than men [aRR = 1.8, 95% CI(1.2
to 2.5)], but with non-labour-related mobility in men [aRR = 2.2, 95% CI(1.5 to
3.4)].
CONCLUSIONS: In rural eastern Africa, both longer-distance/permanent, and
localized/shorter-term forms of mobility are associated with higher-risk
behaviours, and are highly gendered: the HIV risks associated with mobility are
more pronounced for women. Gender-specific interventions among mobile populations
are needed to combat HIV in the region.

Combinatorial insect attacks on maize leaves, stems, and kernels cause
significant yield losses and mycotoxin contaminations. Several small effect
quantitative trait loci (QTL) control maize resistance to stem borers and storage
pests and are correlated with secondary metabolites. However, efficient use of
QTL in molecular breeding requires a synthesis of the available resistance
information. In this study, separate meta-analyses of QTL of maize response to
stem borers and storage pests feeding on leaves, stems, and kernels along with
maize cell wall constituents discovered in these tissues generated 24 leaf (LIR),
42 stem (SIR), and 20 kernel (KIR) insect resistance meta-QTL (MQTL) of a diverse
genetic and geographical background. Most of these MQTL involved resistance to
several insect species, therefore, generating a significant interest for
multiple-insect resistance breeding. Some of the LIR MQTL such as LIR4, 17, and
22 involve resistance to European corn borer, sugarcane borer, and southwestern
corn borer. Eleven out of the 42 SIR MQTL related to resistance to European corn 
borer and Mediterranean corn borer. There KIR MQTL, KIR3, 15, and 16 combined
resistance to kernel damage by the maize weevil and the Mediterranean corn borer 
and could be used in breeding to reduce insect-related post-harvest grain yield
loss and field to storage mycotoxin contamination. This meta-analysis
corroborates the significant role played by cell wall constituents in maize
resistance to insect since the majority of the MQTL contain QTL for members of
the hydroxycinnamates group such as p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and other
diferulates and derivates, and fiber components such as acid detergent fiber,
neutral detergent fiber, and lignin. Stem insect resistance MQTL display several 
co-localization between fiber and hydroxycinnamate components corroborating the
hypothesis of cross-linking between these components that provide mechanical
resistance to insect attacks. Our results highlight the existence of
combined-insect resistance genomic regions in maize and set the basis of
multiple-pests resistance breeding.

BACKGROUND: Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) relies on
long-term adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Mobile health approaches,
such as text messaging (short message service, SMS), may improve adherence in
some clinical contexts, but it is unclear what SMS content is desired to improve 
PMTCT-ART adherence.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the SMS content preferences related to engagement 
in PMTCT care among women, male partners, and health care workers. The message
content was used to inform an ongoing randomized trial to enhance the PMTCT-ART
adherence.
METHODS: We conducted 10 focus group discussions with 87 HIV-infected pregnant or
postpartum women and semistructured individual interviews with 15 male partners
of HIV-infected women and 30 health care workers from HIV and maternal child
health clinics in Kenya. All interviews were recorded, translated, and
transcribed. We analyzed transcripts using deductive and inductive approaches to 
characterize women's, partners', and health care workers' perceptions of text
message content.
RESULTS: All women and male partners, and most health care workers viewed text
messages as a useful strategy to improve engagement in PMTCT care. Women desired 
messages spanning 3 distinct content domains: (1) educational messages on PMTCT
and maternal child health, (2) reminder messages regarding clinic visits and
adherence, and (3) encouraging messages that provide emotional support. While all
groups valued reminder and educational messages, women highlighted emotional
support more than the other groups (partners or health care workers). In
addition, women felt that encouraging messages would assist with acceptance of
their HIV status, support disclosure, improve patient-provider relationship, and 
provide support for HIV-related challenges. All 3 groups valued not only messages
to support PMTCT or HIV care but also messages that addressed general maternal
child health topics, stressing that both HIV- and maternal child health-related
messages should be part of an SMS system for PMTCT.
CONCLUSIONS: Women, male partners, and health care workers endorsed SMS text
messaging as a strategy to improve PMTCT and maternal child health outcomes. Our 
results highlight the specific ways in which text messaging can encourage and
support HIV-infected women in PMTCT to remain in care, adhere to treatment, and
care for themselves and their children.

BACKGROUND: Top priorities for tuberculosis control and elimination include a
simple, low-cost screening test using sputum and a non-sputum-based test in
patients that do not produce sputum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
performance of a colorimetric sensor array (CSA) test, for analysis of volatile
organic compounds in urine, in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine samples were collected from individuals suspected of 
having pulmonary TB in Western Kenya. Reference methods included MGIT culture
and/or Xpert MTB/RIF nucleic acid amplification test on sputa. Fresh urine
samples were tested with the CSA, with acid and base and without an additive. The
CSA were digitally imaged, and the resulting colorimetric response patterns were 
used for chemometric analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative (NPV) and
positive predictive (PPV) values were determined for HIV-positive and
HIV-negative patients.
RESULTS: In HIV-negative patients, the highest accuracy was obtained in urine
samples pre-treated with a base, yielding a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and
NPV of 78.3% (65/83), 69.2% (54/78), 73.0% (n/89) and 75.0% (n/72). The highest
sensitivity of 79.5% was achieved using sensor data from all three test
conditions at a specificity of 65.4%. In HIV-positive subjects, the sensor
performance was substantially lower with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV
ranging from 48.3% to 62.3%, 54.1% to 74.0%, 55.9% to 64.2%, and 60.6% to 64.9%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The CSA fingerprint of urine headspace volatiles showed moderate
accuracy in diagnosing TB in HIV-negative patients, but the sensor performance
dropped substantially in HIV-coinfected patients. Further development of
TB-responsive CSA indicators may improve the accuracy of CSA urine assay.

BACKGROUND: Gendered power dynamics within couple relationships can constrain
women from achieving positive sexual and reproductive health outcomes. But little
is known about relationship power among adolescents, and tools to measure it are 
rarely validated among adolescents. We tested the Sexual Relationship Power Scale
(SRPS) among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and examined associations
with select health outcomes.
METHODS: A 16-item adaptation of the SRPS was administered to AGYW aged 15-24 in 
Kenya (n = 1,101). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and theta coefficients
assessed scale performance for three age bands: 15-17, 18-20, and 21-24 years
old. Relationship power levels were examined and multivariate logistic
regressions assessed the relationship between power, and partner violence and HIV
risk outcomes.
RESULTS: CFAs confirmed a one factor structure for each subgroup, and thetas for 
final 15-item scales were robust (>.82). Most respondents reported limited power 
in their sexual relationships, however older respondents consistently reported
lower levels of power. Relationship power was strongly associated with several
outcomes, even when controlling for socioeconomic status and schooling. For
example, AGYW who reported more relationship power were 12, 6, and 7 times less
likely (ages 21-24, 18-20, and 15-17, respectively) to experience sexual violence
(p<0.001). Significant relationships were also found in multivariate analyses for
physical partner violence (all three age bands), using a condom at last sex
(18-20-year-olds), and increased knowledge of partner's HIV status
(21-24-year-olds).
CONCLUSIONS: The SRPS is a good measure of relationship power for several age
bands within AGYW, and power is experienced differently by older and younger
AGYW. Low relationship power was a consistent predictor of partner violence, as
well as an important predictor of HIV risk. Interventions seeking to address HIV 
and violence should also explicitly address relationship power and utilize
validated tools (like the SRPS) to evaluate impacts.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a 1-year community health worker intervention
improves access to care and service utilization among Latinos with diabetes.
METHODS: We conducted a single-blind randomized trial of 300 adults with poorly
controlled diabetes treated in 2 public hospital clinics in Miami, Florida. We
began enrollment in 2010 and completed follow-up in 2015. We examined access and 
utilization using self-reported measures and data from electronic medical
records.
RESULTS: Participants randomized to the community health worker intervention
self-reported fewer problems accessing needed care and prescriptions than did
those in the usual care group (30% vs 43% and 28% vs 41%, respectively; P < .05
for both). Adjusting for age, gender, education, depression, and comorbidities
showed similar results (odds ratio [OR] = 0.52; 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 0.29, 0.93 and OR = 0.45; CI = 0.24, 0.82, respectively). We found no
significant utilization differences in primary care visits, emergency department 
utilization, or hospitalization between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Among Latinos with poorly controlled diabetes, a 1-year community
health worker intervention was associated with improvements in self-reported
access to care but not service utilization.

transmission cycles of VBDs are often strongly mediated by the ecological
requirements of the vectors, resulting in complex transmission dynamics,
including intermittent epidemics and an unclear link between environmental
conditions and disease persistence. An important broader concern is the extent to
which theoretical models are reliable at forecasting VBDs; infection dynamics can
be complex, and the resulting systems are highly unstable. Here, we examine these
problems in detail using a case study of Rift Valley fever (RVF), a high-burden
disease endemic to Africa. We develop an ecoepidemiological, compartmental,
mathematical model coupled to the dynamics of ambient temperature and water
availability and apply it to a realistic setting using empirical environmental
data from Kenya. Importantly, we identify the range of seasonally varying ambient
temperatures and water-body availability that leads to either the extinction of
mosquito populations and/or RVF (nonpersistent regimens) or the establishment of 
long-term mosquito populations and consequently, the endemicity of the RVF
infection (persistent regimens). Instabilities arise when the range of the
environmental variables overlaps with the threshold of persistence. The model
captures the intermittent nature of RVF occurrence, which is explained as
low-level circulation under the threshold of detection, with intermittent
emergence sometimes after long periods. Using the approach developed here opens
up the ability to improve predictions of the emergence and behaviors of epidemics
of many other important VBDs.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in Kenya.
However, only 3% of women are routinely screened. This study aimed to assess
women's knowledge and attitudes towards cervical cancer and cervical cancer
screening in Kenya's Isiolo and Tharaka Nithi counties.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and March 2017.
Using a multistage cluster sampling methodology, 451 women 18 years of age and
older participated in the study. Interviewers administered a 35-item
questionnaire collecting demographic information, knowledge of risk factors and
attitudes towards cervical cancer and cervical cancer screening. Bivariate and
multivariate analyses of cervical cancer knowledge and demographic
characteristics were conducted.
RESULTS: The response rate for the study was 98% (451/460). Two-thirds of the
study participants originated from Tharaka Nithi county (n = 318). Respondents
reported a median age of 32; 70.5% were married; and 35.0% had primary education.
Eighty percent of the participants were aware of cervical cancer, 25.6% of whom
had previously undergone a cervical screening examination, and 44.4% had
above-average knowledge of risk factors of cervical cancer. Knowledge of cervical
cancer risk factors was significantly associated with employment status (adjusted
odds ratio = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.0-2.6) and county of origin (adjusted odds
ratio = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.6-5.0). Almost all (89.2%) of those who had heard of
cervical cancer categorised it as "scary". There was a marginal significant
difference in the overall attitude assessment score towards cervical cancer
between participants from Isiolo and Tharaka Nithi counties; the mean (SD) score 
was 2.13 (0.34) and 2.20 (0.30) respectively. The score was comparatively higher 
among participants residing in Tharaka Nithi (95% CI: 0.002-0.146; p = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to increase cervical cancer knowledge are needed in
Isiolo and Tharaka Nithi counties, Kenya. Additional research is needed to
further understand and assess the effectiveness of different strategies to
improve attitudes regarding cervical cancer in order to increase the uptake of
screening services, particularly among less-educated women and those in
hard-to-reach areas.

As antiretroviral therapy (ART) expands in resource-limited settings,
understanding the impact of ART on pregnancy outcomes is critical. We analyzed
women who became pregnant on ART while enrolled in a clinical trial (HPTN 052,
ACTG A5208, and ACTG A5175); the majority of women were from Africa, with a
median age of 29 years. Eligible women were on ART at conception and had a
documented date of a last menstrual period and a pregnancy outcome. The primary
outcome was non-live birth (stillbirth; spontaneous abortion; elective
termination; or ectopic pregnancy) versus live birth. Preterm birth (<37 weeks
completed gestation) was a secondary outcome. We used Cox proportional hazards
regression models with time-varying covariates. 359 women became pregnant, of
whom 253 (70%) met inclusion criteria: 127 (50%) were on NNRTI-based ART, 118
(47%) on PI-based ART, and 8 (3%) on 3-NRTIs at conception. There were 160 (63%) 
live births (76 term and 84 preterm), 11 (4%) stillbirths, 51 (20%) spontaneous
abortions, 28 (11%) elective terminations, and 3 (1%) ectopic pregnancies. In
multivariable analysis adjusted for region, parent study, and pre-pregnancy ART
class, only older age was associated with increased hazard of preterm birth [HR: 
2.49 for age 25-30 years; 95% CI: 1.18-5.26; p = 0.017]. Women conceiving on ART 
had high rates of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Despite the
benefits of ART, studies designed to investigate the effects of preconception ART
on pregnancy outcomes are needed.

BACKGROUND: Zimbabwe adopted voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) as a
priority HIV prevention strategy in 2007 and began implementation in 2009. We
evaluated the costs and impact of this VMMC program to date and in future.
METHODS: Three mathematical models describing Zimbabwe's HIV epidemic and program
evolution were calibrated to household survey data on prevalence and risk
behaviors, with circumcision coverage calibrated to program-reported VMMCs. We
compared trends in new infections and costs to a counterfactual without VMMC.
Input assumptions were agreed in workshops with national stakeholders in 2015 and
2017.
RESULTS: The VMMC program averted 2,600-12,200 infections (among men and women
combined) by the end of 2016. This impact will grow as circumcised men are
protected lifelong, and onward dynamic transmission effects, which protect women 
via reduced incidence and prevalence in their male partners, increase over time. 
If other prevention interventions remain at 2016 coverages, the VMMCs already
performed will avert 24,400-69,800 infections (2.3-5% of all new infections)
through 2030. If coverage targets are achieved by 2021 and maintained, the
program will avert 108,000-171,000 infections (10-13% of all new infections) by
2030, costing $2,100-3,250 per infection averted relative to no VMMC. Annual
savings from averted treatment needs will outweigh VMMC maintenance costs once
coverage targets are reached. If Zimbabwe also achieves ambitious UNAIDS targets 
for scaling up treatment and prevention efforts, VMMC will reduce the HIV
incidence remaining at 2030 by one-third, critically contributing to the UNAIDS
goal of 90% incidence reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: VMMC can substantially impact Zimbabwe's HIV epidemic in the coming 
years; this investment will save costs in the longer term.

We investigated the quill mite fauna of the family Syringophilidae (Acariformes: 
Prostigmata) associated with Sunbirds (Passeriformes: Nectariniidae) in the
Sub-Saharan region. Six hundred eleven host individuals belonging to 52 species
were examined. Syringophilid parasitization prevalence (44 hosts of 15 species)
ranged from 1.4 to 75% in particular host species. In the collected material, we 
have found seven quill mite species and among them four are new for science: 1)
Aulobia afroanthreptes Skoracki & Zmudzinski sp. nov. from Anthreptes neglectus
Neumann, 1922 and Anthreptes longuemarei (Lesson, 1831), both from Tanzania; 2)
Syringophiloidus nectariniae Skoracki & Zmudzinski sp. nov. from Hedydipna
collaris (Vieillot, 1819) from Tanzania; 3) Aulonastus nectariniphilus Skoracki &
Zmudzinski sp. nov. from Anthreptes reichenowi Gunning, 1909 from Tanzania and
Nectarinia tacazze (Stanley, 1814) from Ethiopia; and 4) Picobia hedydipna
Skoracki & Zmudzinski sp. nov. from Hedydipna collaris from Kenya.
Representatives of the genera Aulonastus Kethley, 1970 and Syringophiloidus
Kethley, 1970 are recorded on Sunbirds for the first time. The following new host
species are given: Cinnyris mariquensis Smith, 1836, C. shelleyi Alexander, 1899 
and C. regius Reichenov, 1893, all from Tanzania for Aulobia nectariniae Skoracki
& Glowska, 2008; A. neglectus and A. longuemarei, both from Tanzania for
Neoaulonastus cinnyris Klimovicova et al., 2014; Cyanomitra verreauxii (Smith,
1832) from Tanzania and Cinnyris chalybeus (Linnaeus, 1766) from South Africa for
Picobia oritis Skoracki et al., 2009. Additionally, host-parasite relationships
are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Acute excess iodine intake can damage the thyroid, but the effects of
chronic excess iodine intake are uncertain. Few data exist for pregnant and
lactating women and infants exposed to excessive iodine intake.
METHODS: This was a multicenter cross-sectional study. At study sites in rural
Kenya and urban Tanzania previously reporting iodine excess in children, urinary 
iodine concentration (UIC), thyrotropin, total thyroxine, and thyroglobulin (Tg) 
were measured in school-age children (SAC), women of reproductive age, pregnant
(PW) and lactating women, and breast-feeding and weaning infants. In a national
study in Djibouti, UIC was measured in SAC and PW. At all sites, daily iodine
intake was estimated based on UIC, and iodine concentration was measured in
household salt and drinking water.
RESULTS: The total sample size was 4636: 1390, 2048, and 1198 subjects from
Kenya, Tanzania, and Djibouti, respectively. In Kenya and Tanzania: (i) median
UIC was well above thresholds for adequate iodine nutrition in all groups and
exceeded the threshold for excess iodine intake in SAC; (ii) iodine
concentrations >40 mg of iodine/kg were found in approximately 55% of household
salt samples; (iii) iodine concentrations ≥10 μg/L were detected in 9% of
drinking water samples; (iv) Tg was elevated in all population groups, but the
prevalence of thyroid disorders was negligible, except that 5-12% of women of
reproductive age had subclinical hyperthyroidism and 10-15% of PW were
hypothyroxinemic. In Djibouti: (i) the median UIC was 335 μg/L (interquartile
range [IQR] = 216-493 μg/L) in SAC and 265 μg/L (IQR = 168-449 μg/L) in PW; (ii) 
only 1.6% of Djibouti salt samples (n = 1200) were adequately iodized
(>15 mg/kg); (iii) the median iodine concentration in drinking water was 92 μg/L 
(IQR = 37-158 μg/L; n = 77). In all countries, UIC was not significantly
correlated with salt or water iodine concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: Although iodine intake was excessive and Tg concentrations were
elevated, there was little impact on thyroid function. Chronic excess iodine
intake thus appears to be well tolerated by women, infants, and children.
However, such high iodine intake is unnecessary and should be avoided. Careful
evaluation of contributions from both iodized salt and groundwater iodine is
recommended before any review of iodization policy is considered.

Introduction: Müllerian duct anomalies represent a group of congenital
malformations that result from failure to complete bilateral paramesonephric duct
elongation, fusion, canalization, or septal resorption. These anomalies are rare 
in the general population with a bicornuate or didelphys uterus being among the
common ones. Bicornuate uterine malformations are of clinical significance due to
their adverse reproductive outcomes. Metroplasty has been shown to improve
reproductive outcomes of bicornuate uterine malformations. We document a case of 
bicornuate uterus that was managed with Strassman metroplasty and a subsequent
successful pregnancy outcome.
Case: A Black African lady was seen with a history of six prior miscarriages. Her
diagnostic workup revealed a bicornuate uterus for which she had a Strassman
metroplasty performed. She later conceived and was followed up to term with a
successful live birth.
Conclusion: Strassman metroplasty is a rare procedure in Sub-Saharan Africa and
this case seeks to add to the body of knowledge on surgical management of
Müllerian duct anomalies specifically bicornuate uterus in this region. This case
report aims to increase the awareness of Müllerian duct abnormalities
specifically bicornuate uterus in cases of recurrent miscarriages and highlight
the diagnostic strategies to investigate and to demonstrate management options in
low resource settings.

OBJECTIVES: Vaginal dysbiosis and STIs are important drivers of the HIV epidemic 
and reproductive complications. These conditions remain prevalent, partly because
most cases are asymptomatic. We have shown that inflammatory cytokines
interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β and interferon-γ-induced protein (IP)-10 are
biomarkers for detecting asymptomatic STIs and vaginal dysbiosis (bacterial
vaginosis (BV) or intermediate microbiota). This study aimed to validate the
performance of these biomarkers in African women recruited regardless of
symptoms.
METHODS: IL-1α, IL-1β and IP-10 were measured in menstrual cup secretions,
endocervical, lateral vaginal wall and vulvovaginal swabs from 550 women from
Pretoria, Soweto and Cape Town, South Africa and Bondo, Kenya using Luminex and
ELISA. STIs were assessed by PCR, BV by Nugent scoring and vaginal microbiota by 
16S rRNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Across four study populations and four types of genital specimens, the
performance of IL-1α, IL-1β and IP-10 for identification of women with STIs, BV
or intermediate microbiota was consistent. Of the genital samples assessed,
biomarkers measured in lateral vaginal wall swabs performed best, correctly
classifying 76%(95% CI 70% to 81%) of women according to STI, BV or intermediate 
microbiota status (sensitivity 77%, specificity 71%) and were more accurate than 
clinical symptoms (sensitivity 41%, specificity 57%) (p=0.0003). Women
incorrectly classified as STI/BV positive using the biomarkers had more abundant 
dysbiosis-associated bacteria, including Prevotella bivia and Gardnerella sp,
detected by 16S rRNA sequencing, but not Nugent scoring. Including vaginal pH
with the cytokine biomarkers improved the accuracy of the test (82% (95% CI 75%
to 88%) correctly classified), although pH alone had poor specificity (61%).
CONCLUSIONS: An inexpensive, point-of-care screening test including IL-1α, IL-1β 
and IP-10 (and potentially pH) could be used in resource-limited settings to
identify women with asymptomatic STIs and dysbiosis. These women could then be
referred for aetiological testing, followed by specific treatment.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the endemic Leishmania species, the
clinical features of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the Central Rift Valley in
Kenya and to give an account on unresponsiveness to treatment in the region.
METHODS: Participants were clinically identified and grouped into untreated,
classical and recidivate based on clinical manifestation and clinical data.
Leishmaniasis recidivans lesions were scaly hyperemic papules that appeared
before the classic lesion had healed or after healing. The demographics and
socio-economic data were recorded and lesion scraping samples screened through
microscopy and Internal Transcribed Spacer 1-PCR. Leishmania species were
identified using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism.
RESULTS: A total of 52 participants were sampled, of which, 44.2% of the cases
were recidivate and L. tropica the only species identified. All patients had been
treated using sodium stibogluconate (SSG) which is the recommended first-line
drug in Kenya. 60% of the patients experienced prolonged exposure to the drug
(>30 days).
CONCLUSION: L. tropica is the endemic Leishmania species for CL leading to
classical and leishmaniasis recidivans. Treatment of CL in the area is not
effective hence, alternative measures/therapy should be considered to cope with
the unresponsiveness.

Begomoviruses are considered as one of the most notorious plant viruses
worldwide, which cause substantial economic losses to various field crops.
Management of begomoviruses has become a challenge due to the continuous
evolution and the emergence of new strains. Bemisia tabaci is globally known to
be the key vector of begomoviruses, having relatively high reproductivity, fast
dispersal ability, high survival rate due to its polyphagous nature and high
resistance to various groups of insecticides. Continuous transmission of
begomoviruses by the vector has led to the development and spread of epidemics of
various diseases worldwide. In this review, we have critically analyzed the
various dynamics which facilitate the diversity of begomoviruses through their
vector. The interaction of begomovirus-whitefly leads to continuous research
activities regarding management of both virus and its vector, thus opening
exciting new horizons to formulate potential control strategies to ensure a
disease-free cropping environment.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to estimate the unmet burden of
surgically correctable congenital anomalies in African low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs).
METHODS: We conducted a chart review of children operated for cryptorchidism,
isolated cleft lip, hypospadias, bladder exstrophy and anorectal malformation at 
an Ethiopian referral hospital between January 2012 and July 2016 and a scoping
review of the literature describing the management of congenital anomalies in
African LMICs. Procedure numbers and age at surgery were collected to estimate
mean surgical delays by country and extrapolate surgical backlog. The unmet
surgical need was derived from incidence-based disease estimates, established
disability weights, and actual surgical volumes.
RESULTS: The chart review yielded 210 procedures in 207 patients from Ethiopia.
The scoping review generated 42 data sets, extracted from 36 publications,
encompassing: Benin, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Madagascar,
Malawi, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The largest national surgical backlog
was noted in Nigeria for cryptorchidism (209,260 cases) and cleft lip (4154
cases), and Ethiopia for hypospadias (20,188 cases), bladder exstrophy (575
cases) and anorectal malformation (1349 cases).
CONCLUSION: These data support the need for upscaling pediatric surgical capacity
in LMICs to address the significant surgical delay, surgical backlog, and unmet
prevalent need.

BACKGROUND: Spatial isolation, diverging environmental conditions and social
structures may lead to the differentiation of various traits, e.g. molecules,
morphology and behaviour. Bird calls may provide important information on effects
of geographic isolation and may reflect diverging ecological conditions related
to altitude. Furthermore, bird calls are strongly shaped by the social behaviour 
of species. The Kenyan endemic bird Hinde's Babbler, Turdoides hindei, is a
cooperative breeder existing in distinct family groups. The species occurs in
five isolated population groups at different altitudes across its distribution
range in south-eastern Kenya. With this model species we test for potential
effects of geographic isolation, diverging altitudes, and social structures. We
recorded and analysed contact and alarm calls of T. hindei, including its entire 
distribution range and all existing population groups.
RESULTS: Our data show significant differentiation of call characteristics among 
population groups across the species' distribution range. This differentiation is
correlated with geographical distance, but also with altitude. We also found
strong call differentiation among neighbouring family groups. Call
differentiation of contact calls was comparatively high in comparison to alarm
calls, which showed a lower degree of divergence.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that call differentiation is governed by geographic
isolation as well as altitude. Diverging degrees of call differentiation in
contact and alarm calls suggests that both call types are under different
selective pressures. Alarm calls are required to be understood by all members of 
the species across the entire distribution range and thus call differentiation is
lower. In contrast, contact calls are more specific and differ even among
neighbouring families supporting the maintenance of distinct bird families and
groups.

A model for predicting utilization of mHealth interventions in low-resource
settings: case of maternal and newborn care in Kenya.

BACKGROUND: In low-resource settings, there are numerous socioeconomic challenges
such as poverty, inadequate facilities, shortage of skilled health workers,
illiteracy and cultural barriers that contribute to high maternal and newborn
deaths. To address these challenges, there are several mHealth projects
particularly in Sub-Sahara Africa seeking to exploit opportunities provided by
over 90% rate of mobile penetration. However, most of these interventions have
failed to justify their value proposition to inspire utilization in low-resource 
settings.
METHODS: This study proposes a theoretical model named Technology, Individual,
Process-Fit (TIPFit) suitable for user-centred evaluation of intervention designs
to predict utilization of mHealth products in low-resource settings. To
investigate the predictive power of TIPFit model, we operationalized its latent
constructs into variables used to predict utilization of an mHealth prototype
called mamacare. The study employed single-group repeated measures
quasi-experiment in which a random sample of 79 antenatal and postnatal patients 
were recruited from a rural hospital. During the study conducted between May and 
October 2014, the treatment involved sending and receiving SMS alerts on vital
signs, appointments, safe delivery, danger signs, nutrition, preventive care and 
adherence to medication.
RESULTS: Measurements taken during the study were cleaned and coded for analysis 
using statistical models like Partial Least Squares (PLS), Repeated Measures
Analysis of Variance (RM-ANOVA), and Bonferroni tests. After analyzing 73 pretest
responses, the model predicted 80.2% fit, and 63.9% likelihood of utilization.
However, results obtained from initial post-test taken after three months
demonstrated 69.1% fit, and utilization of 50.5%. The variation between
prediction and the actual outcome necessitated improvement of mamacare based on
feedback obtained from users. Three months later, we conducted the second
post-test that recorded further drop in fit from 69.1 to 60.3% but utilization
marginally improved from 50.5 to 53.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite variations between the pretest and post-test outcomes, the
study demonstrates that predictive approach to user-centred design offers greater
flexibility in aligning design attributes of an mHealth intervention to fulfill
user needs and expectations. These findings provide a unique contribution for
decision makers because it is possible to prioritize investments among competing 
digital health projects.

BACKGROUND: More than half of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) consumed
globally are dispensed in the retail sector, where diagnostic testing is
uncommon, leading to overconsumption and poor targeting. In many malaria-endemic 
countries, ACTs sold over the counter are available at heavily subsidized prices,
further contributing to their misuse. Inappropriate use of ACTs can have serious 
implications for the spread of drug resistance and leads to poor outcomes for
nonmalaria patients treated with incorrect drugs. We evaluated the public health 
impact of an innovative strategy that targets ACT subsidies to confirmed malaria 
cases by coupling free diagnostic testing with a diagnosis-dependent ACT subsidy.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 32
community clusters in western Kenya (population approximately 160,000). Eligible 
clusters had retail outlets selling ACTs and existing community health worker
(CHW) programs and were randomly assigned 1:1 to control and intervention arms.
In intervention areas, CHWs were available in their villages to perform malaria
rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) on demand for any individual >1 year of age
experiencing a malaria-like illness. Malaria RDT-positive individuals received a 
voucher for a discount on a quality-assured ACT, redeemable at a participating
retail medicine outlet. In control areas, CHWs offered a standard package of
health education, prevention, and referral services. We conducted 4
population-based surveys-at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months-of a
random sample of households with fever in the last 4 weeks to evaluate
predefined, individual-level outcomes. The primary outcome was uptake of malaria 
diagnostic testing at 12 months. The main secondary outcome was rational ACT use,
defined as the proportion of ACTs used by test-positive individuals. Analyses
followed the intention-to-treat principle using generalized estimating equations 
(GEEs) to account for clustering with prespecified adjustment for gender, age,
education, and wealth. All descriptive statistics and regressions were weighted
to account for sampling design. Between July 2015 and May 2017, 32,404
participants were tested for malaria, and 10,870 vouchers were issued. A total of
7,416 randomly selected participants with recent fever from all 32 clusters were 
surveyed. The majority of recent fevers were in children under 18 years (62.9%, n
= 4,653). The gender of enrolled participants was balanced in children (49.8%, n 
= 2,318 boys versus 50.2%, n = 2,335 girls), but more adult women were enrolled
than men (78.0%, n = 2,139 versus 22.0%, n = 604). At baseline, 67.6% (n = 1,362)
of participants took an ACT for their illness, and 40.3% (n = 810) of all
participants took an ACT purchased from a retail outlet. At 12 months, 50.5% (n =
454) in the intervention arm and 43.4% (n = 389) in the control arm had a malaria
diagnostic test for their recent fever (adjusted risk difference [RD] = 9
percentage points [pp]; 95% CI 2-15 pp; p = 0.015; adjusted risk ratio [RR] =
1.20; 95% CI 1.05-1.38; p = 0.015). By 18 months, the ARR had increased to 1.25
(95% CI 1.09-1.44; p = 0.005). Rational use of ACTs in the intervention area
increased from 41.7% (n = 279) at baseline to 59.6% (n = 403) and was 40% higher 
in the intervention arm at 18 months (ARR 1.40; 95% CI 1.19-1.64; p < 0.001).
While intervention effects increased between 12 and 18 months, we were not able
to estimate longer-term impact of the intervention and could not independently
evaluate the effects of the free testing and the voucher on uptake of testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis-dependent ACT subsidies and community-based interventions 
that include the private sector can have an important impact on diagnostic
testing and population-wide rational use of ACTs. Targeting of the ACT subsidy
itself to those with a positive malaria diagnostic test may also improve
sustainability and reduce the cost of retail-sector ACT subsidies.

BACKGROUND: In utero exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
(NRTI)-containing antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens may be associated with 
poor neurodevelopmental functioning in children of HIV-infected mothers. We
investigated neurodevelopmental outcomes of HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children
of HIV-infected women enrolled in a randomized trial of
abacavir/zidovudine/lamivudine (Triple-NRTI regimen) vs.
lopinavir/ritonavir/zidovudine/lamivudine (Dual NRTI+PI regimen).
SETTING: The Mma Bana randomized trial was conducted in urban and rural sites in 
Botswana.
METHODS: The Mma Bana study randomized HIV-infected pregnant women with CD4 ≥ 200
cells/mm to a triple-NRTI vs. dual-NRTI+PI regimen from 26-34 weeks gestation
through planned weaning at 6 months postpartum. Partway through the study,
neurodevelopmental assessments were added at 24 months of age, including the
Developmental Milestones Checklist, the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler
Development 3 edition, Ten Questions Questionnaire, and Profile of Social
Emotional Development. We evaluated differences in mean scores between the two
arms using unadjusted and adjusted linear regression.
RESULTS: A total of 197 HEU infants (48% male) completed a neurodevelopmental
assessment (101 in triple-NRTI arm; 96 in dual-NRTI+PI-exposed arm). Means for
all neurodevelopmental outcomes were similar for children of mothers randomized
to either ART regimen, with no significant differences in either unadjusted or
adjusted models (estimated effect sizes ranging from -0.12 to 0.14).
CONCLUSION: Neurodevelopmental outcomes in 24-month-old HEU children of
HIV-infected mothers with baseline CD4≥200 were similar in those randomized to a 
dual-NRTI+PI-based versus a triple-NRTI-based ART regimen, suggestive of lack of 
short term toxicity. Monitoring of long term toxicity and newer regimens is
warranted.

Devices to safely transfer fixed amounts of finger prick blood to rapid
diagnostic tests (RDTs) pose a significant challenge, especially in
non-laboratory settings. Following the success of an "inverted cup device" for
transfer of 5 μL blood, a prototype with a conical cup shape was developed for
transfer of 20 μL blood, the amount needed for human immunodeficiency virus or
human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) RDTs. This study determined the volume of
blood transferred by this new blood transfer device (BTD) and compared its ease
of use, safety, and acceptability with that of a plastic pipette when used by
health workers (HWs) for HAT RDTs in northwestern Uganda. After a half-day
training, 48 HWs had used the two BTDs with at least 10 patients. The conical cup
BTD effectively transferred a mean of 22.76 μL of blood (standard deviation 3.31 
μL). A significantly higher proportion of HWs were able to collect the full
amount of blood using the conical cup BTD, as compared with the pipette (92.4%
versus 74.2%, P < 0.001). In HW questionnaires, the conical cup BTD scored higher
than the pipette in various aspects of ease of use and safety. In addition, HWs
preferred the conical cup BTD (79%), indicating that it was easy to handle, made 
work faster, and increased their confidence in front of the patient. These
findings suggest that the design of the conical cup BTD may be adapted for RDTs
requiring 20 μL of blood to facilitate safe and accurate blood transfer.

Human intestinal schistosomiasis is caused by the blood fluke, Schistosoma
mansoni. With intensified efforts to control schistosomiasis by mass drug
administration using praziquantel (PZQ), there is an urgent need to have
accessible, quality-assured diagnostic tests for case detection and disease
surveillance and for monitoring efficacy of treatment and other interventions.
Current diagnostic tools are limited by suboptimal sensitivity, slow
turn-around-time, affordability, and inability to distinguish current from past
infections. We describe a simple and rapid diagnostic assay, based on the
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology for diagnosis of S.
mansoni infection in human faecal samples. The LAMP primers used in this assay
were previously described and they target a 121-bp DNA repeat sequence in S.
mansoni. The LAMP assay was optimized at an isothermal temperature of 63°C for 1 
hour. The amplified DNA was either visualized under ultraviolet light after
electrophoresis or by directly observing the color change after staining the
amplicons with CYBR Green dye. The LAMP assay was evaluated against the
microscopy-based procedure and the results were analysed using Cohen's kappa
coefficient to determine the degree of agreement between the two techniques. The 
LAMP assay reliably detected S. mansoni ova DNA in faecal samples and parasite
DNA in amounts as low as 32fg. When the assay was tested for specificity against 
other faecal-based soil-transmitted helminths (STH), no cross-reactivity was
observed. The LAMP assay was superior to the Kato-Katz assay with a 97%
specificity; a high positivity score reliably detecting S. mansoni and a Kappa
Coefficient of 0.9 suggested an exceptional agreement between the two techniques.
The LAMP assay developed has great potential for application in field settings to
support S. mansoni control and elimination campaigns.

Lanyamycin (1/2), a secondary metabolite occurring as two epimers, was isolated
from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum, strain Soce 481. The structures of
both epimers were elucidated from HRESIMS and 1D and 2D NMR data and the relative
configuration of their macrolactone ring was assigned based on NOE and vicinal 1H
NMR coupling constants and by calculation of a 3D model. Lanyamycin inhibited HCV
infection into mammalian liver cells with an IC50 value of 11.8 µM, and exhibited
a moderate cytotoxic activity against the mouse fibroblast cell line L929 and the
human nasopharyngeal cell line KB3 with IC50 values of 3.1 and 1.5 μM,
respectively, and also suppressed the growth of the Gram-positive bacterium
Micrococcus luteus.

BACKGROUND: Childhood visual impairment is a major public health concern that
requires effective screening and early intervention. We investigated the
effectiveness of Peek school eye health, a smartphone-based sight test and
referral system (comprising Peek Acuity test, sight simulation referral cards,
and short message service [SMS] reminders), versus standard care (Snellen's
Tumbling-E card and written referral).
METHODS: We initially compared the performance of both the Snellen Tumbling-E
card and the Peek Acuity test to a standard backlit EDTRS LogMAR visual acuity
test chart. We did a cluster randomised controlled trial to compare the Peek
school eye health system with standard school screening care, delivered by school
teachers. Schools in Trans Nzoia County, Kenya, were eligible if they did not
have an active screening programme already in place. Schools were randomly
allocated (1:1) to either the Peek school eye health screening and referral
programmes (Peek group) or the standard care screening and referral programme
(standard group). In both groups, teachers tested vision of children in years
1-8. Pupils with visual impairment (defined as vision less than 6/12 in either
eye) were referred to hospital for treatment. Referred children from the standard
group received a written hospital referral letter. Participants and their
teachers in the Peek group were shown their simulated sight on a smartphone and
given a printout of this simulation with the same hospital details as the
standard referral letter to present to their parent or guardian. They also
received regular SMS reminders to attend the hospital. The primary outcome was
the proportion of referred children who reported to hospital within 8 weeks of
referral. Primary analysis was by intention to treat, with the intervention
effect estimated using odds ratios. This trial is registered with Pan African
Clinical Trial Registry, number PACTR201503001049236.
FINDINGS: Sensitivity was similar for the Peek test and the standard test (77%
[95% CI 64·8-86·5] vs 75% [63·1-85·2]). Specificity was lower for the Peek test
than the standard test (91% [95% CI 89·3-92·1] vs 97·4% [96·6-98·1]). Trial
recruitment occurred between March 2, 2015, and March 13, 2015. Of the 295
eligible public primary schools in Trans Nzoia County, 50 schools were randomly
selected and assigned to either the Peek group (n=25) or the standard group
(n=25). 10 579 children were assessed for visual impairment in the Peek group and
10 284 children in the standard group. Visual impairment was identified in 531
(5%) of 10 579 children in the Peek group and 366 (4%) of 10 284 children in the 
standard care group. The proportion of pupils identified as having visual
impairment who attended their hospital referral was significantly higher in the
Peek group (285 [54%] of 531) than in the standard group (82 [22%] of 366; odds
ratio 7·35 [95% CI 3·49-15·47]; p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: The Peek school eye health system increased adherence to hospital
referral for visual impairment assessment compared with the standard approach
among school children. This indicates the potential of this technology package to
improve uptake of services and provide real-time visibility of health service
delivery to help target resources.

BACKGROUND: Caesarean section prevalence is increasing in Asia and Latin America 
while remaining low in most African regions. Caesarean section delivery is
effective for saving maternal and infant lives when they are provided for
medically-indicated reasons. On the basis of ecological studies, caesarean
delivery prevalence between 9% and 19% has been associated with better maternal
and perinatal outcomes, such as reduced maternal land fetal mortality. However,
the specific prevalence of obstetric and medical complications that require
caesarean section have not been established, especially in low-income and
middle-income countries (LMICs). We sought to provide information to inform the
approach to the provision of caesarean section in low-resource settings.
METHODS: We did a literature review to establish the prevalence of obstetric and 
medical conditions for six potentially life-saving indications for which
caesarean section could reduce mortality in LMICs. We then analysed a large,
prospective population-based dataset from six LMICs (Argentina, Guatemala, Kenya,
India, Pakistan, and Zambia) to determine the prevalence of caesarean section by 
indication for each site. We considered that an acceptable number of events would
be between the 25th and 75th percentile of those found in the literature.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2013, we enrolled a total of 271 855
deliveries in six LMICs (seven research sites). Caesarean section prevalence
ranged from 35% (3467 of 9813 deliveries in Argentina) to 1% (303 of 16 764
deliveries in Zambia). Argentina's and Guatemala's sites all met the minimum 25th
percentile for five of six indications, whereas sites in Zambia and Kenya did not
reach the minimum prevalence for caesarean section for any of the indications.
Across all sites, a minimum overall caesarean section of 9% was needed to meet
the prevalence of the six indications in the population studied.
INTERPRETATION: In the site with high caesarean section prevalence, more than
half of the procedures were not done for life-saving conditions, whereas the
sites with low proportions of caesarean section (below 9%) had an insufficient
number of caesarean procedures to cover those life-threatening causes. Attempts
to establish a minimum caesarean prevalence should go together with focusing on
the life-threatening causes for the mother and child. Simple methods should be
developed to allow timely detection of life-threatening conditions, to explore
actions that can remedy those conditions, and the timely transfer of women with
those conditions to health centres that could provide adequate care for those
conditions.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium malariae is characterized by its long asymptomatic
persistence in the human host. The epidemiology of P. malariae is incompletely
understood and is hampered by the limited knowledge of genetic polymorphisms.
Previous reports from Africa have shown heterogeneity within the P. malariae
circumsporozoite protein (pmcsp) gene. However, comparative studies from Asian
countries are lacking. Here, the genetic polymorphisms in pmcsp of Asian isolates
have been characterized.
METHODS: Blood samples from 89 symptomatic P. malariae-infected patients were
collected, from Thailand (n = 43), Myanmar (n = 40), Lao PDR (n = 5), and
Bangladesh (n = 1). pmcsp was amplified using semi-nested PCR before sequencing. 
The resulting 89 pmcsp sequences were analysed together with 58 previously
published pmcsp sequences representing African countries using BioEdit, MEGA6,
and DnaSP.
RESULTS: Polymorphisms identified in pmcsp were grouped into 3 populations:
Thailand, Myanmar, and Kenya. The nucleotide diversity and the ratio of
nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) in Thailand and Myanmar were
higher compared with that in Kenya. Phylogenetic analysis showed clustering of
pmcsp sequences according to the origin of isolates (Asia vs. Africa). High
genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.404) was observed between P. malariae isolates
from Asian and African countries. Sequence analysis of pmcsp showed the presence 
of tetrapeptide repeat units of NAAG, NDAG, and NAPG in the central repeat region
of the gene. Plasmodium malariae isolates from Asian countries carried fewer
copies of NAAG compared with that from African countries. The NAPG repeat was
only observed in Asian isolates. Additional analysis of 2 T-cell epitopes, Th2R
and Th3R, showed limited heterogeneity in P. malariae populations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable information on the genetic
polymorphisms in pmcsp isolates from Asia and advances our understanding of P.
malariae population in Asia and Africa. Polymorphisms in the central repeat
region of pmcsp showed association with the geographical origin of P. malariae
isolates and can be potentially used as a marker for genetic epidemiology of P.
malariae population.

BACKGROUND: Africa's health systems rely on services provided by mid-level health
workers (MLWs). Investment in their training is worthwhile since they are more
likely to be retained in underserved areas, require shorter training courses and 
are less dependent on technology and investigations in their clinical practice
than physicians. Their training programs and curricula need up-dating to be
relevant to their practice and to reflect advances in health professional
education. This study was conducted to review the training and curricula of MLWs 
in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda, to ascertain areas for improvement.
METHODS: Key informants from professional associations, regulatory bodies,
training institutions, labour organisations and government ministries were
interviewed in each country. Policy documents and training curricula were
reviewed for relevant content. Feedback was provided through stakeholder and
participant meetings and comments recorded. 421 District managers and 975 MLWs
from urban and rural government district health facilities completed
self-administered questionnaires regarding MLW training and performance.
RESULTS: Qualitative data indicated commonalities in scope of practice and in
training programs across the four countries, with a focus on basic diagnosis and 
medical treatment. Older programs tended to be more didactic in their training
approach and were often lacking in resources. Significant concerns regarding
skills gaps and quality of training were raised. Nevertheless, quantitative data 
showed that most MLWs felt their basic training was adequate for the work they
do. MLWs and district managers indicated that training methods needed updating
with additional skills offered. MLWs wanted their training to include more
problem-solving approaches and practical procedures that could be life-saving.
CONCLUSIONS: MLWs are essential frontline workers in health services, not just a 
stop-gap. In Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda, their important role is appreciated by
health service managers. At the same time, significant deficiencies in training
program content and educational methodologies exist in these countries, whereas
programs in South Africa appear to have benefited from their more recent origin. 
Improvements to training and curricula, based on international educational
developments as well as the local burden of disease, will enable them to function
with greater effectiveness and contribute to better quality care and outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Refugees in sub-Saharan Africa face both the risk of HIV infection
and barriers to HIV testing. We conducted a pilot study to determine the
feasibility and acceptability of home-based HIV testing in Nakivale Refugee
Settlement in Uganda and to compare home-based and clinic-based testing
participants in Nakivale.
METHODS: From February-March 2014, we visited homes in 3 villages in Nakivale up 
to 3 times and offered HIV testing. We enrolled adults who spoke English,
Kiswahili, Kinyarwanda, or Runyankore; some were refugees and some Ugandan
nationals. We surveyed them about their socio-demographic characteristics. We
evaluated the proportion of individuals encountered (feasibility) and assessed
participation in HIV testing among those encountered (acceptability). We compared
characteristics of home-based and clinic-based testers (from a prior study in
Nakivale) using Wilcoxon rank sum and Pearson's chi-square tests. We examined the
relationship between a limited number of factors (time of visit, sex, and number 
of individuals at home) on willingness to test, using logistic regression models 
with the generalized estimating equations approach to account for clustering.
RESULTS: Of 566 adults living in 319 homes, we encountered 507
(feasibility = 90%): 353 (62%) were present at visit one, 127 (22%) additional
people at visit two, and 27 (5%) additional people at visit three. Home-based HIV
testing participants totaled 378 (acceptability = 75%). Compared to clinic-based 
testers, home-based testers were older (median age 30 [IQR 24-40] vs 28 [IQR
22-37], p < 0.001), more likely refugee than Ugandan national (93% vs 79%,
< 0.001), and more likely to live ≥1 h from clinic (74% vs 52%, < 0.001). The HIV
prevalence was lower, but not significantly, in home-based compared to
clinic-based testing participants (1.9 vs 3.4% respectively, p = 0.27). Testing
was not associated with time of visit (p = 0.50) or sex (p = 0.66), but for each 
additional person at home, the odds of accepting HIV testing increased by over
50% (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.12-2.06, p = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Home-based HIV testing in Nakivale Refugee Settlement was feasible, 
with 90% of eligible individuals encountered within 3 visits, and acceptable with
75% willing to test for HIV, with a yield of nearly 2% individuals tested
identified as HIV-positive.

BACKGROUND: Globally, 40% of all tuberculosis (TB) cases, 65% paediatric cases
and 75% multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases are missed due to underreporting
and/or under diagnosis. A recent Kenyan TB prevalence survey found that a
significant number of TB cases are being missed here. Understanding spatial
distribution and patterns of use of TB diagnostic tests as per the guidelines
could potentially help improve TB case detection by identifying diagnostic gaps.
METHODS: We used 2015 Kenya National TB programme data to map TB case
notification rates (CNR) in different counties, linked with their capacity to
perform diagnostic tests (chest x-rays, smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF®, culture
and line probe assay). We then ran hierarchical regression models for adults and 
children to specifically establish determinants of use of Xpert® (as per Kenyan
guidelines) with county and facility as random effects.
RESULTS: In 2015, 82,313 TB cases were notified and 7.8% were children. The
median CNR/100,000 amongst 0-14yr olds was 37.2 (IQR 20.6, 41.0) and 267.4 (IQR
202.6, 338.1) for ≥15yr olds respectively. 4.8% of child TB cases and 12.2% of
adult TB cases had an Xpert® test done, with gaps in guideline adherence. There
were 2,072 microscopy sites (mean microscopy density 4.46/100,000); 129 Xpert®
sites (mean 0.31/100,000); two TB culture laboratories and 304 chest X-ray
facilities (mean 0.74/100,000) with variability in spatial distribution across
the 47 counties. Retreatment cases (i.e. failures, relapses/recurrences,
defaulters) had the highest odds of getting an Xpert® test compared to
new/transfer-in patients (AOR 7.81, 95% CI 7.33-8.33). Children had reduced odds 
of getting an Xpert® (AOR 0.41, CI 0.36-0.47). HIV-positive individuals had
nearly twice the odds of getting an Xpert® test (AOR 1.82, CI 1.73-1.92). Private
sector and higher-level hospitals had a tendency towards lower odds of use of
Xpert®.
CONCLUSIONS: We noted under-use and gaps in guideline adherence for Xpert®
especially in children. The under-use despite considerable investment undermines 
cost-effectiveness of Xpert®. Further research is needed to develop strategies
enhancing use of diagnostics, including innovations to improve access (e.g.
specimen referral) and overcoming local barriers to adoption of guidelines and
technologies.

The individual impacts of several components of family planning service quality
on contraceptive use have been studied, but the influence of a composite measure 
synthesizing these components has not been often investigated. We (1) develop a
composite score for family planning service quality based on health facility data
from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda and (2) examine the influence of
structural quality on contraceptive practice in these four countries. We used
nationally representative cross-sectional survey data of health facilities and
women of reproductive age. First, we constructed quality scores for facilities
using principal component analysis to integrate 18 variables. Second, we linked
women to their closest facility using geo-coordinates. Third, we estimated
multivariable logistic regression models to calculate women's odds ratios for
modern contraceptive use adjusting for facilities' quality and other factors. In 
Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Uganda, the odds of using a modern method of
contraception was greater if the nearest facility provided high- or
medium-quality services compared with low quality in the univariable model. After
controlling for possible confounders, the adjusted odds ratios were significant
for high quality (aOR: 3.12, P value: 0.005) and medium quality (aOR: 2.57, P
value: 0.009) in Ethiopia and in the hypothesized direction but not statistically
significant in Uganda or Burkina Faso, and in the opposite direction in Kenya. A 
process quality measure-having been visited by a community health worker-was
statistically significantly associated with modern contraceptive use in three of 
the four countries (Burkina Faso aOR: 2.18, P value: 0.000; Ethiopia aOR: 1.78, P
value: 0.000; Uganda aOR: 1.96, P value: 0.012). These results suggest that
service quality in public facilities may be less relevant to contraceptive use in
environments where the universe and reach of providers changes actively. Programs
promoting contraception therefore need to consider quality within facility types 
and their service environments.

Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) plays an important role in sustainable food security
and livelihood improvement in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The crop is rich in
phytonutrients and minerals, which are key in solving malnutrition and hunger
crisis, a major challenge in SSA. However, physiological status, storage
temperature and duration affect phytonutrient levels and postharvest life of the 
leafy vegetable. Despite the significant importance of cowpeas, the maturity and 
postharvest storage effects on quality of the leafy vegetable remains unrevealed.
The aim of this study was to analyze the dynamics of phytonutrients in cowpea
leaves during development under field conditions in Kenya and in storage. The
total carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sucrose and starch) were highest at 90 d 
after planting (105.9 ± 2.5 g kg-1) compared to 30, 60 and 120 d. The
total Phenolics (Gallic acid equivalents) increased gradually with age up to
12.0 ± 0.2 g kg-1 by 120 d. Catechin equivalent flavonoids, trolox equivalent
antioxidants (TEA) and chlorophyll were highest in concentrations at 60 d after
planting with 8.0 ± 0.5 g kg-1, 26.19 ± 0.5 g kg-1 and 5.7 ± 0.4 g kg-1,
respectively. Quercetin equivalent flavonoids and total carotenoids did not show 
significant changes with age, while mineral concentration dynamics were specific 
for each element. Storage of cowpea leaves at room temperature (50-55 % relative 
humidity) led to a stronger decline of phytonutrients after 4 d, but mostly they 
remained stable at cold storage (5 °C). Results of this study highlight the
importance of developmental stage at harvest, storage conditions and duration for
the optimal availability of phytonutrients in freshly consumed leaves and for
postharvest management strategies.
